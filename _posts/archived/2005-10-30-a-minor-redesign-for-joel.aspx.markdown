Software pundit [Joel Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/) finally
[added titles](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/10/30.html) to
his RSS feeds (among other site improvements) and it’s about time. The
title “November 5, 2005” tells me nothing about what he’s saying. Love
him or hate him (*why choose one or the other. Choose both!*), Joel is
definitely worth reading.
