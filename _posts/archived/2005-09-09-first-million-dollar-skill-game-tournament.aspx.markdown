I [learned through Mr. Wagner](http://wagnerblog.com/index.php?p=466)
that my former employer [just
announced](http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/September2005/08/c7052.html)
the first ever [million dollar skill game
tournament](http://gogames.skilljam.com/help/milliondollartourn_rules.asp).

To win the tournament one must be the best all-around at their three
most popular games, Solitaire, Zuma and Bejeweled 2. These games are
among the most popular “casual” games around. Casual gaming is the term
used for games that do not target the hard-core gaming audience such as
Half-Life and Quake. The typical casual gamer is a thirty year-old
mother in the midwest.
