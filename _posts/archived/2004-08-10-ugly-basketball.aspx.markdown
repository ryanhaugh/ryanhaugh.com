![Basketball](/images/basketball.jpg)Basketball was ugly this morning.
Lots of bickering and fouling. Dan, you didn't miss much man. Sometimes
you just want to slap everyone upside the head and tell them to grow up
and graduate from Pre-School. But that's insulting to pre-schoolers who
are much more mature than the fellas this morning. Then again, sometimes
you wish you'd just make the damn game winning shot instead of clanking
it in and out.
