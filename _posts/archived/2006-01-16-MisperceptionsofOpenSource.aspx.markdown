Tim hits it on the mark. If Subtext is a pawn in some larger economic
force, I’d be curious to find out which major corporate power seeks to
gain, and perhaps ask them for some funding. ;)

In truth, there are many reasons people work on open source software,
and they are not all the same. Many just find it fun to work on
something more interesting than the boring data-in data-out systems they
build at work. Some want to have a hand in building a better mousetrap.
Many enjoy participating in a community and perhaps gaining a bit of
recognition among their peers. A few see it as a political movement
against capitalist interests. Yet others are paid to work on open source
projects as it benefits their employer. None of these reasons are
inherently wrong, misguided or amoral.

Many of these articles criticising open source focus on the big
projects. What they fail to look at is that the majority of open source
projects are very small. Many fill very niche markets that corporations
have no interest in filling, but that there is yet a long-tail demand
for.
