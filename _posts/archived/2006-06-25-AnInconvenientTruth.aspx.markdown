![Movie Poster](http://haacked.com/images/AnInconvenientTruth.jpg)
Watched a free screening of this last night in Downtown Los Angeles as
part of a film festival. Prior to the screening, Jon Bon Jovi and Richie
Sambora played some live music and Al Gore was on hand to introduce the
movie. Mayor Villaraigosa was also there oddly suited in a tux and
comically referring to Richie as Richie *Santora*.

**The basic premise of the documentary is that humans are affecting the
Earth’s climate, this is a very bad thing, we can do something about it,
and we don’t have to destroy the economy to do it.**

This particular premise is also the subject of much controversy, which
Al addresses in the documentary. He points out that there is an
overwhelming scientific consensus that humans are affecting the Earth’s
climate change. A [study of 928 peer reviewed
abstracts](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/306/5702/1686 "Scientific Consensus on Climate Change")
in scientific journals between 1993 and 2003 on the topic of climate
change showed absolutely none disagreed with the consensus. The
controversy, in large part has been hyped up by the popular media as
well as the minority nay-sayers.

The movie also points out that the idea of humans affecting the climate
is not so farfetched and in fact has a precedent. Consider the hole in
the ozone layer that was a big worry back in the 80s. The EPA states
that ozone deplection was [caused by human
activities](http://www.epa.gov/ozone/science/q_a.html#q3 "Ozone Depletion").

Recent headlines are showing the effects of global warmings.

    stronger](http://news.mongabay.com/2006/0622-ucar.html "2005 record hurricane season")
-   [Greenland’s Ice Sheet Is Slip-Sliding
    Away](http://www.latimes.com/news/science/la-sci-greenland25jun25,0,1308610.story?coll=la-home-headlines "Greenland Ice Sheet Melting")
-   [Wildfires worries rise in drought-stricken
    Southwest](http://www.usatoday.com/weather/news/2006-03-08-southwest-wildfires_x.htm "Southwest wildfires")

The key point to stress is that Al Gore does not believe that we have to
sacrifice our economy or jobs in order to become more ecologically
friendly. In fact, he believes it will lead to more jobs. As a case in
point, Japan’s auto industry has the most stringent auto emission
standards and highest [eco
ranking](http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/dec2002/2002-12-04-10.asp "Japan leads eco ranking")
and they are kicking the butt of Ford and GM in profits.

One of the most revealing points (as well as embarassing for the U.S.)
is when he shows that the U.S. auto emission standards are significantly
below China! China! Since when is China the example to the U.S. on clean
air?

At the end, Al points out that turning around the negative effects of
human activities can be done, and there is a precedent. We don’t worry
much about ozone depletion today because the U.S. took the lead in
creating treaties to ban CFC production.

This is a worthwhile movie to see whatever your political affiliations,
because it is an issue that will eventually affect everyone regardless
of political affiliations. Republicans aren’t immune to the weather. If
you are skeptical that we are causing global warming, then see it
anyways and refute the claims.
