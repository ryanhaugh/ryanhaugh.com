![Soccer Ball](http://haacked.com/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg)One thing I
love about my soccer league is that they have a [kick butt
website](http://eteamz.com/olympicsl/ "Olympic Soccer League"). The
design isn’t much to look at, but the site is chock full of useful
information both current and historical.

For example, you can see how my team (Westside Rovers) [did last
season](http://eteamz.active.com/olympicsl/standings/index.cfm?season=300166&cat=618861&division=2538958&show=schedule&tteam=3568182&xdiv=1&subsite=3568182&league=2538279 "Standings").
Tied for fourth isn’t such a bad showing for our first season in the
league, but check out the GF and GA column.

Ouch! That is 24 goals we scored while there were 54 goals scored
against us in fourteen games. That means we scored an average of 1.7
goals per game, while being scored on an average of 3.9 goals a game.
When we got beat, we really got beat. Notice that LA Blues, the lead
leaders scored 19 goals on us. We played them twice. Double ouch!

There’s no lesson here other than sometimes, you really are better off
not knowing the detailed stats. At least we have an easy target to beat
for the upcoming season.

The reason for the disparity becomes apparent when you read the
following blurb on the front page.

None of those players are on our team.

In really bad news, we had a pre-season friendly this past Saturday
against another team in the league. They had a new player who was trying
out for the team who made a vicious sliding tackle (no slide tackles
allowed in our league due to the fields policies) on my teammate,
breaking his tibia and fibia. The sound of the contact made a
sickeningly loud **crack!** and bent his leg in an unsightly manner. It
may take a while, but I hope he has a speedy recovery. Meanwhile, I am
looking into better health insurance.
