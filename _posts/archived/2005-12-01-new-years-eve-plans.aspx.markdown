In case you were wondering, [this is where](http://giantvillage.com/) my
wife and I will be spending our New Years Eve this year. Some of the
highlights of the expansive line-up include John Digweed, Christopher
Lawrence, The Crystal Method, Miguel Migs, Muytaytor and Black Eyed Peas
(though they seem a bit out of place, they are a hot ticket).

This is one of them big-fangled parties, taking up six blocks in
downtown Los Angeles. Yeah, there will be a lot of people (maybe even
too many), but this particular party has sentimental value since it is
the party my wife and I met at in 2001/2002. Weâ€™ll make sure to ride the
ferris wheel.

In part, I post this to make
[Jayson](http://jaysonknight.com/blog/default.aspx) jealous.
