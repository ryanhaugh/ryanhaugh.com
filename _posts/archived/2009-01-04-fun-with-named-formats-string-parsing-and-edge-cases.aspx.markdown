DOUBLE UPDATE! Be sure to [read Peli’s
post](http://blog.dotnetwiki.org/2009/01/16/NamedFormatsPexTestimonium.aspx "Named Formats Pex")
in which he explores all of these implementations using PEX. Apparently
I have a lot more unit tests to write in order to define the expected
behavior of the code.

UPDATE: By the way, after you read this post, check out [the post in
which I revisit this
topic](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/01/14/named-formats-redux.aspx "Named Formats Redux")
and add two more implementations to check out.

Recently I found myself in a situation where I wanted to format a string
using a named format string, rather than a positional one. Ignore for
the moment the issue on whether this is a good idea or not, just trust
me that I’ll be responsible with it.

The existing `String.Format` method, for example, formats values
according to position.

```csharp
string s = string.Format("{0} first, {1} second", 3.14, DateTime.Now);
```

But what *I* wanted was to be able to use the name of properties/fields,
rather than position like so:

```csharp
var someObj = new {pi = 3.14, date = DateTime.Now};
string s = NamedFormat("{pi} first, {date} second", someObj);
```

Looking around the internet, I quickly found three implementations
mentioned in [this StackOverflow
question](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/159017/named-string-formatting-in-c "StackOverflow").

-   [A Smarter (or Pure Evil) ToString with Extension
    Methods](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=fde45b51-9d12-46fd-b877-da6172fe1791 "ToString with named formats")
    by Scott Hanselman.
-   [C\#: String.Inject() – Format strings by key
    tokens](http://mo.notono.us/2008/07/c-stringinject-format-strings-by-key.html "String.Inject")
    from Oskar.
-   [FormatWith 2.0 – String Formatting with named
    variables](http://james.newtonking.com/archive/2008/03/29/formatwith-2-0-string-formatting-with-named-variables.aspx "FormatWith 2.0")
    by James Newton-King.

All three implementations are fairly similar in that they all use
regular expressions for the parsing. Hanselman’s approach is to write an
extension method of `object` (note that this won’t work in VB.NET until
they allow extending `object`). James and Oskar wrote extension methods
of the `string` class. James takes it a bit further by using
`DataBinder.Eval` on each token, which allows you to have formats such
as {foo.bar.baz} where `baz` is a property of `bar` which is a property
of `foo`. This is something else I wanted, which the others do not
provide.

He also makes good use of the `MatchEvaluator` delegate argument to the
`Regex.Replace` method, perhaps one of the most underused yet powerful
features of the `Regex` class. This ends up making the code for his
method very succinct.

Handling Brace Escaping
-----------------------

I hade a chat about this sort of string parsing with
[Eilon](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/ "Eilon Lipton") recently and
he mentioned that many developers tend to ignore or get escaping wrong.
So I thought I would see how these methods handle a simple test of
escaping the braces.

`String.Format` with the following:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(String.Format("{{ "{{" }}{0}}}", 123));
```

produces the output (sans quotes) of “{123}”

So I would expect with each of these methods, that:

```csharp
Console.WriteLine(NamedFormat("{{ "{{" }}{foo}}}", new {foo = 123}));
```

Would produce the exact same output, “{123}”. However, only James’s
method passed this test. But when I expanded the test to the following
format, “{{ "{{" }}{{ "{{" }}{foo}}}}}”, all three failed. That should have produced
“{{ "{{" }}123}}”.

Certainly this is not such a big deal as this really is an edge case,
but you never know when an [edge case might bite
you](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/BackToBasicsExploreTheEdgeCasesOrDateMathWillGetYou.aspx "Edge Case")
as Zune owners learned recently. More importantly, it poses an
interesting problem - how do you handle this correctly? I thought it
would be fun to try.

This is possible to handle correctly using regular expressions, but it’s
challenging. Not only are you dealing with [balanced
matching](http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2005/03/15/396452.aspx "Regex and Balanced Matching"),
but the matching depends on whether the number of consecutive braces are
odd or even.

For example, the following “{0}}” is not valid because the right end
brace is escaped. However, “{0}}}” is valid. The expression is closed
with the leftmost end brace, which is followed by an even number of
consecutive braces, which means they are all escaped sequences.

Performance
-----------

As I mentioned earlier, only James’s method handles evaluation of
sub-properties/fields via the use of the `DataBinder.Eval` method.
Critics of his blog post point out that this is a performance killer.

Personally, until I’ve measured it in the scenarios in which I plan to
use it, I doubt that the performance will really be an issue compared to
everything else going on. But I thought I would check it out anyways,
writing a simple console app which runs each method over 1000
iterations, and then divides by 1000 to get the number of milliseconds
each method takes. Here’s the result:

![format
perf](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/FunWithNamedFormatsStringParsingandEdgeC_B4E3/format-perf_3.png "format perf")

Notice that James’s method is 43 times slower than Hanselman’s. Even so,
it only takes 4.4 milliseconds. So if you don’t use it in a tight loop
with a lot of iterations, it’s not horrible, but it could be better.

My Implementation
-----------------

At this point, I thought it would be fun to write my own implementation
using manual string parsing rather than regular expressions. I’m not
sure my regex-fu is capable of handling the challenges I mentioned
before. After implementing my own version, I ran the performance test
and saw the following result.

![haackformat
perf](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/FunWithNamedFormatsStringParsingandEdgeC_B4E3/haackformat-perf_3.png "haackformat perf")

Nice! by removing the overhead of using a regular expression in this
particular case, my implementation is faster than the other
implementations, despite my use of `DataBinder.Eval`. Hopefully my
implementation is correct, because fast and wrong is even worse than
slow and right.

One drawback to not using regular expressions is that the code for my
implementation is a bit long. I include the entire source here. I’ve
also **[zipped up the code for this
solution](http://haacked.com/code/NamedStringFormatSolution.zip "Named String Format Solution")**
which includes unit tests as well as the implementations of the other
methods I tested, so you can see which tests they pass and which they
don’t pass.

The core of the code is in two parts. One is a private method which
parses and splits the string into an enumeration of segments represented
by the `ITextExpression` interface. The method you call joins these
segments together, evaluating any expressions against a supplied object,
and returning the resulting string.

I think we could optimize the code even more by joining these operations
into a single method, but I really liked the separation between the
parsing and joining logic as it helped me wrap my head around it.
Initially, I hoped that I could cache the parsed representation of the
format string since strings are immutable thus I could re-use it. But it
didn’t end up giving me any real performance gain when I measured it.

```csharp
public static class HaackFormatter
{
  public static string HaackFormat(this string format, object source)
  {

    if (format == null) {
        throw new ArgumentNullException("format");
    }

    var formattedStrings = (from expression in SplitFormat(format)
                 select expression.Eval(source)).ToArray();
    return String.Join("", formattedStrings);
  }

  private static IEnumerable<ITextExpression> SplitFormat(string format)
  {
    int exprEndIndex = -1;
    int expStartIndex;

    do
    {
      expStartIndex = format.IndexOfExpressionStart(exprEndIndex + 1);
      if (expStartIndex < 0)
      {
        //everything after last end brace index.
        if (exprEndIndex + 1 < format.Length)
        {
          yield return new LiteralFormat(
              format.Substring(exprEndIndex + 1));
        }
        break;
      }

      if (expStartIndex - exprEndIndex - 1 > 0)
      {
        //everything up to next start brace index
        yield return new LiteralFormat(format.Substring(exprEndIndex + 1
          , expStartIndex - exprEndIndex - 1));
      }

      int endBraceIndex = format.IndexOfExpressionEnd(expStartIndex + 1);
      if (endBraceIndex < 0)
      {
        //rest of string, no end brace (could be invalid expression)
        yield return new FormatExpression(format.Substring(expStartIndex));
      }
      else
      {
        exprEndIndex = endBraceIndex;
        //everything from start to end brace.
        yield return new FormatExpression(format.Substring(expStartIndex
          , endBraceIndex - expStartIndex + 1));

      }
    } while (expStartIndex > -1);
  }

  static int IndexOfExpressionStart(this string format, int startIndex) {
    int index = format.IndexOf('{', startIndex);
    if (index == -1) {
      return index;
    }

    //peek ahead.
    if (index + 1 < format.Length) {
      char nextChar = format[index + 1];
      if (nextChar == '{') {
        return IndexOfExpressionStart(format, index + 2);
      }
    }

    return index;
  }

  static int IndexOfExpressionEnd(this string format, int startIndex)
  {
    int endBraceIndex = format.IndexOf('}', startIndex);
    if (endBraceIndex == -1) {
      return endBraceIndex;
    }
    //start peeking ahead until there are no more braces...
    // }}}}
    int braceCount = 0;
    for (int i = endBraceIndex + 1; i < format.Length; i++) {
      if (format[i] == '}') {
        braceCount++;
      }
      else {
        break;
      }
    }
    if (braceCount % 2 == 1) {
      return IndexOfExpressionEnd(format, endBraceIndex + braceCount + 1);
    }

    return endBraceIndex;
  }
}
```

And the code for the supporting classes

```csharp
public class FormatExpression : ITextExpression
{
  bool _invalidExpression = false;

  public FormatExpression(string expression) {
    if (!expression.StartsWith("{") || !expression.EndsWith("}")) {
      _invalidExpression = true;
      Expression = expression;
      return;
    }

    string expressionWithoutBraces = expression.Substring(1
        , expression.Length - 2);
    int colonIndex = expressionWithoutBraces.IndexOf(':');
    if (colonIndex < 0) {
      Expression = expressionWithoutBraces;
    }
    else {
      Expression = expressionWithoutBraces.Substring(0, colonIndex);
      Format = expressionWithoutBraces.Substring(colonIndex + 1);
    }
  }

  public string Expression { 
    get; 
    private set; 
  }

  public string Format
  {
    get;
    private set;
  }

  public string Eval(object o) {
    if (_invalidExpression) {
      throw new FormatException("Invalid expression");
    }
    try
    {
      if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(Format))
      {
        return (DataBinder.Eval(o, Expression) ?? string.Empty).ToString();
      }
      return (DataBinder.Eval(o, Expression, "{0:" + Format + "}") ?? 
        string.Empty).ToString();
    }
    catch (ArgumentException) {
      throw new FormatException();
    }
    catch (HttpException) {
      throw new FormatException();
    }
  }
}

public class LiteralFormat : ITextExpression
{
  public LiteralFormat(string literalText) {
    LiteralText = literalText;
  }

  public string LiteralText { 
    get; 
    private set; 
  }

  public string Eval(object o) {
    string literalText = LiteralText
        .Replace("{{ "{{" }}", "{")
        .Replace("}}", "}");
    return literalText;
  }
}
```

I mainly did this for fun, though I plan to use this method in Subtext
for email fomatting.

Let me know if you find any situations or edge cases in which my version
fails. I’ll probably be adding more test cases as I integrate this into
Subtext. As far as I can tell, it handles normal formatting and brace
escaping correctly.
