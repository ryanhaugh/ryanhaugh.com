I’m not one to post a lot of quizzes on my blog. Let’s face it, while we
may create altruistic reasons for posting quizzes such as:

1.  It’s an [interesting
    problem](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/11/08/Code-Puzzle-_2300_1-_2D00_-What-numbers-under-one-million-are-divisible-by-their-reverse_3F00_.aspx "What numbers under one million are divisible by their reverse’")
    I thought up
2.  It’s an [interesting
    bug](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/11/17/quiz-what-is-wrong-with-this-code.aspx "What is wrong with this code’")
    I [ran
    into](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/21/difference-between-isnull-and-coalesce.aspx "Bug I Ran Into")

we all know the *real* reasons for posting a quiz.

1.  It serves as blog filler.
2.  It’s a way to show off how smart the blogger is.

With that in mind, let me humbly present my latest SQL Quiz, which is
something I ran into at work recently, and will not show off any smarts
whatsoever.

The circumstances of this problem have been dramatically changed and
simplified to both protect the guilty and save me from a lot of typing.

In this application, we have two tables. One contains a lookup list of
various statistics. The second is a larger table of measurements for
each of the statistics.

The following screenshot shows the data model.

The following screenshot shows the list of contrived statistics.

![Statistic Table
Data](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/c994658a199e_148AD/image022.png)

What we see above are the following:

1.  **LOC per bug** - Lines of code per bug.
2.  **Simplicity Index** - some magical number that purports to measure
    simplicity.
3.  **Awe Factor** - The awe factor for the source code.

For each of these statistics, the larger, the better.

The following is a view of the Measurement table.

![Measurement Table
Data](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/c994658a199e_148AD/image041.png)

Each measurement has the previous score and current score (this is a
denormalized version of the actual tables for the purposes of
demonstration).

I needed to write a query that would show each of the stats for a given
developer as well as a Trend Factor. The Trend Factor tells you whether
or not the statistic is trending positive or negative, where positive is
better and negative is worse.

![Result of the
query](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/c994658a199e_148AD/image036.png)

Here is my first cut at the stored procedure. It’s pretty
straightforward. In order to make the important part of the query as
clear as possible, I used a [Common Table
Expression](http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/webtech/071906-1.shtml "Common Table Expression")
to make sure the count of measurements for each statistic can be
referenced as if it were a column.

```sql
CREATE PROC [dbo].[Statistics_GetForDeveloper](
  @Developer nvarchar(64)
)
AS
WITH MeasurementCount(StatisticId, MeasurementCount) AS
(
  SELECT s.Id
    ,MeasurementCount = COUNT(1)
  FROM Statistic s
    LEFT OUTER JOIN Measurement m ON m.StatisticId = s.Id
  GROUP BY s.Id
)
SELECT 
  Statistic = s.Title
  , Developer
  , CurrentScore
  , PreviousScore
  , mc.MeasurementCount
  , TrendFactor = (CurrentScore - PreviousScore)/mc.MeasurementCount
FROM Statistic s
  INNER JOIN MeasurementCount mc ON mc.StatisticId = s.Id
  LEFT OUTER JOIN Measurement m ON m.StatisticID = s.Id
WHERE Developer = @Developer
GO
```

I bolded the relevant part of the query. We calculate the TrendFactor by
taking the current score, subtracting the previous score, and then
dividing the difference by the number of measurements for that
particular statistic. This tells us how that statistic is *trending*.

In this application, I am going to present an up arrow for trend factors
larger than 0.1, a down arrow for trend factors less than -0.1, and a
flat line for anything in between. A trend factor going upward is always
considered a “good thing”.

### The Challenge

This works for now because for each statistic, a larger value is
considered better. But we need to add a new statistic, *Deaths per LOC*,
which measures the number of deaths per line of code (gruesome, yes. But
whoever said this industry is all roses and rainbows?). For this
statistic, an upward trend is a “*bad* thing”.

Therefore, if the current score is larger than the previous score for
this statistic, we would want the TrendFactor to be negative. Not only
that, we may want to add more statistics in the future. Some for which
larger values are better. And some for which smaller values are better.

So here is the quiz question. You are allowed to make a schema change to
the Statistic table and to the stored procedure. **What changes would
you make to fulfill the requirements?**

**Bonus points, can you fulfill the requirements without using a `CASE`
statement in the stored procedure?**

Here is a [SQL
script](http://haacked.com/code/Sql-Quiz-001.zip "The SQL Script") that
willl setup the tables and initial stab at the stored procedure for you.
The script requires SQL Server 2005 or SQL Server Express 2005.
