One of the complaints I often here with our our default view engine and
Pages is that there’s all this extra cruft in there with the whole page
directive and stuff. But it turns out that you can get rid of a lot of
it. Credit goes to [David
Ebbo](http://blogs.msdn.com/davidebb/ "David Ebbo"), the oracle of all
hidden gems within the inner workings of ASP.NET, for pointing me in the
right direction on this.

First, let me show you what the before and after of our default *Index*
view (*reformatted to fit the format for this blog*).

### Before

```aspx-cs
<%@ Page Language="C#" 
  MasterPageFile="~/Views/Shared/Site.Master" 
  Inherits="System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage" %>

<asp:Content ID="indexTitle" 
  ContentPlaceHolderID="TitleContent" runat="server">
    Home Page
</asp:Content>

<asp:Content ID="indexContent" 
  ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server">
    <h2><%= Html.Encode(ViewData["Message"]) %></h2>
    <p>
        To learn more about ASP.NET MVC visit <a href="http://asp.net/mvc" 
        title="ASP.NET MVC Website">http://asp.net/mvc</a>.
    </p>
</asp:Content>
```

### After {.clear}

```aspx-cs
<asp:Content ContentPlaceHolderID="TitleContent" runat="server">
    Home Page
</asp:Content>

<asp:Content ContentPlaceHolderID="MainContent" runat="server">
    <h2><%= Html.Encode(ViewData["Message"]) %></h2>
    <p>
        To learn more about ASP.NET MVC visit <a href="http://asp.net/mvc" 
        title="ASP.NET MVC Website">http://asp.net/mvc</a>.
    </p>
</asp:Content>
```

That ain’t your pappy’s Web Form view. I can see your reaction now:

> *Where’s the page declaration!? Where’s all the Content IDs!? Where’s
> the Master Page declaration!? Oh good, at least runat="server" is
> still there to anchor my sanity and comfort me at night.*

It turns out that ASP.NET provides ways to set many of the defaults
within Web.config. What I’ve done here (and which you can do in an
ASP.NET MVC project or Web Forms project) is to set several of these
defaults.

In the case of ASP.NET MVC, I opened up the *Web.config* file hiding
away in the *Views* directory, not to be confused with the *Web.config*
in your application root.

![views-webconfig](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PutYourViewsandPagesOnaDiet_F0BD/views-webconfig_3.png "views-webconfig")

This *Web.config* is placed here because it is the default for all
Views. I then made the following changes:

1.  Set the `compilation` element’s `defaultLanguage` attribute to
    “C\#”.
2.  Set the `pages` element’s `masterPageFile` attribute to point to
    `~/Views/Shared/Site.master`.
3.  Set the `pages` element’s `pageBaseType` attribute to
    `System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage` (in this case, it was already set as part
    of the default ASP.NET MVC project template).

Below is what the *web.config* file looks like with my changes (*I
removed some details like other elements and attributes just to show the
gist*):

```csharp
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <compilation defaultLanguage="C#" />
    <pages
        masterPageFile="~/Views/Shared/Site.master"
        pageBaseType="System.Web.Mvc.ViewPage"
        userControlBaseType="System.Web.Mvc.ViewUserControl">
    </pages>
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

With this in place, as long as my views don’t deviate from these
settings, I won’t have to declare the *Page* directive.

Of course, if you’re using strongly typed views, you’ll need the *Page*
directive to specify the `ViewPage` type, but that’s it.

Also, don’t forget that you can get rid of all them ugly `Register`
declarations by [registering custom controls in
Web.config](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/14/Register_Custom_Controls_In_Web.config.aspx "Register custom controls").

You can also get rid of those ugly Import directives by importing
namespaces in *Web.config*.

```csharp
<configuration>
  <system.web>
    <pages>
      <namespaces>
        <add namespace="Haack.Mvc.Helpers" />
      </namespaces>
    </pages>
  </system.web>
</configuration>
```

By following these techniques, you can get rid of a *lot* of cruft
within your pages and views and keep them slimmer and fitter. Of course,
what I’ve shown here is merely putting your views on a syntax diet. The
more important diet for your views is to keep the amount of code minimal
and restricted to presentation concerns, but that’s a post for another
day as Rob [has already covered
it](http://blog.wekeroad.com/blog/asp-net-mvc-avoiding-tag-soup/ "Avoiding Tag Soup").

Sadly, there is no getting rid of `runat="server"` yet short of
switching [another view
engine](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/12/08/asp.net-mvc-northwind-demo-using-the-spark-view-engine.aspx "Northwind on Spark").
But at this point, I like to think of him as that obnoxious friend from
high school your wife hates but you still keep around to remind you of
your roots. ;)

Hope you enjoy these tips and use them to put your views on a diet.
After all, isn’t it the view’s job to look good for the beach?
