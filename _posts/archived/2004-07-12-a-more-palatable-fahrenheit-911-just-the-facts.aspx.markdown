This may be a more palatable way to understand Fahrenheit 9/11 for many
who are not fans of Michael Moore. His website has a [list of the
facts](http://www.michaelmoore.com/warroom/f911notes/) he presents in
the movie along with the source.

Of course lacking from this list is a fact-checking list for each
source. Also missing is what the significance of each fact is. Some may
fall in the category "So What?" while (in my opinion) many others fall
in the category "Hmmm... Time to vote Bush out."
