I want to teach a friend everything I know about HTML Production work
(which won’t take long). By production work, I mean the process of
receiving a Photoshop file, cutting it up, and producing nice clean
semantic (X)HTML and CSS.

I’m not a master of such things (though I am pretty handy with CSS these
days), but I do know there’s a difference in producing HTML for a static
web page verse producing HTML for a dynamically rendered page such as an
ASP.NET page. It’s those details that I feel I can teach her well that
you don’t learn at many design shops.

However, in preparation, I have a few books and websites I want her to
check out. Let me know what you think of this list and if you’d make any
additions, deletions, etc...

    Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321303474/103-9411210-6787060?v=glance&n=283155&s=books&v=glance)

**Websites**

-   [QuirksMode](http://www.quirksmode.org/)\
     This is a great site for learning CSS and Javascript tips and how
    to deal with browser compatibility issues.

     This site sports insightful articles on web design and CSS. Looking
    at the code behind the site itself is quite educational.

     This is more of a reference and tutorial on how you can use CSS and
    the unordered list `<ul>` element to produce all sorts of lists,
    navbars, menus, etc....
-   [20 CSS Tips and Tricks](http://www.petefreitag.com/item/475.cfm)\
     Tips and tricks for achieving common tasks using CSS.   

Also, I asked some friends what applications they use to cut a photoshop
file and one mentioned Macromedia Fireworks while another just uses
Photoshop. Any tips?

Also, after learning the basics, the following links are important for
understanding the box model problem between Firefox and IE.

**Box Model Hacking**

-   [The IE Box Model and Doctype
    Modes](http://css.maxdesign.com.au/listamatic/about-boxmodel.htm)\
     Explains the Box Model problem and how the Doctype affects it.

-   [Box Model Tweaking](http://www.quirksmode.org/css/box.html)\
     Discusses an upcoming CSS3 declaration that allows the browser to
    change its box model. This (and variants) are supported by some
    browsers already perhaps making it possible have them use the IE box
    model.
