[workspace](http://glazkov.com/Resources/Images/Office/quadraplex-large.jpg)
online. Not sure why
([vanity](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/1322.aspx)!), but they
just do. So I thought I'd jump on that bandwagon and do the same.

This first picture shows my work office with it's nice 17th floor view.

Strange green bands take over the screens.

This next one is our home office.

If you look carefully, you'll notice the hastily minimized porn
application.

As you can see, the home setup is much nicer than the work setup with
dual 17" flat panels monitors, and a slick looking aluminum Shuttle
case. I wish my company would invest in nice monitors. My work monitors
flicker, make me cross-eyed and spit in my food. If you look closely at
the top picture, the computer case is literally held together with
scotch tape on top. The IT department wouldn't budget duct tape.

The little figurine on top is the "[Buddy
Christ](http://store.yahoo.com/jsbstash/budchrisdass1.html)" from
[Dogma](http://imdb.com/title/tt0120655/). You can purchase that on
[Kevin Smith's website](http://www.viewaskew.com/). My wife painted the
red shoe on the left.
