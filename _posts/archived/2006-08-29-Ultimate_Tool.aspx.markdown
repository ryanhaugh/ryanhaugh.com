[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) sets the geek-o-sphere
abuzz with his latest (and apparently now annual) [Ultimate Developer
and Power Users Tool List for
Windows](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ScottHanselmans2006UltimateDeveloperAndPowerUsersToolListForWindows.aspx). 
The publishing of this list usually coincides with a productivity drop
for me as I find many new toys to play with.  Unfortunately, many tools
don’t work so well when running as a non-admin.

This year I was pleased to find my name and my humble little blog on his
list.  Quite pleased in fact until it struck me. 

*Wait one doggone minute!*

Is Scott calling me a **tool**?  An ultimate tool no less.  We’ll see
about that!
