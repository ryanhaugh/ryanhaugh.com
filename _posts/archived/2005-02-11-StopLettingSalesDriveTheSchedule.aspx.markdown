My friend [Thomas Wagner](http://wagnerblog.com/) has a [small epiphany
of sorts](http://wagnerblog.com/index.php?p=344). At first, I thought he
was writing the biography of my first year at my current job. But
apparently this is quite common among businesses.

> Very frequently the profit center of a company drives the development
> schedule and also drives the pressure being excerted on a developer or
> team. Can you guess who the people are that drive most of the profit?
> Those crazy lunatics in the Sales Dept.! Yes, the flunkies who like to

> your schedule and drive your work.

Just the other day, I was working on a task that requires certain
deliverables from the marketing team be in my hand before I can even
begin. Of course those items were delivered late, but naturally I get
several emails in the span of the day asking for the status with wording
like

> This is something a client is waiting to see and technically it’s
> already late. Yadda yadda please get it done ASAP.

My reply was [edited slightly to protect the guilty] (note the weird
pronoun use as time travel is involved).

> I’ll tell you what, I will personally bend space, time and reality so
> that the deliverables will have been delivered to me a week prior to
> the day they actually were. And then I will personally spike

Of course, we have to remember that Sales and Marketing guys have their
own pressures and are human too. Sometimes they aren’t all flunkies and
can even be intelligent and witty as his reply indicates:

> I think I saw a quantum computer at the local pawn shop... crazy shit.

Afterwards I reminded myself not to be such a jackass to this guy. But
then again, the more of a jackass I am, the funnier he gets.
