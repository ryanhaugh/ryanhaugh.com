Developers take pride in speaking their mind and not shying away from
touchy subjects. Yet there is one subject makes many developers
uncomfortable.

Testing.

I’m not talking about drug testing, unit testing, or any form of
automated testing. After all, while there are still some holdouts, at
least these types of tests involve *writing code*. And we know how much
developers love to write code (_even though that’s not what we’re
really paid to do_](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/08/26/not-paid-to-write-code.aspx/ "We're not paid to write code")).

No, I’m talking about the kind of testing where you get your hands dirty
*actually trying the application*. Where you attempt to break the
beautifully factored code you may have just written. At the end of this
post, I’ll provide a tip using GitHub that’s helped me with this.

TDD isn’t enough
----------------

I’m a huge fan of Test Driven Development. I know, I know. TDD isn’t about testing as [Uncle
Bob](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/ "Uncle Bob")
sayeth from on high in his book, [Agile Software Development,
Principles, Patterns, and
Practices](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0135974445/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0135974445&linkCode=as2&tag=youvebeenhaac-20),

> The act of writing a unit test is more an act of design than of
> verification.

And I agree! TDD is primarily about the design of your code. But notice
that Bob doesn’t omit the verification part. He simply provides more
emphasis to the act of design.

In my mind it’s like wrapping a steak in bacon. The steak is the primary
focus of the meal, but I sure as hell am not going to throw away the
bacon! *I know, half of you are hitting the reply button to suggest you
prefer the bacon. Me too but allow me this analogy.*

The problem I’ve found myself running into, despite my [own
advice](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/09/test-first-development-doesnt-mean-you-dont-walk-through-your-code.aspx/ "Walkthrough your code")
to [the
contrary](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/11/03/codecoverageisnotenough.aspx "Code Coverage is not enough"),
is that I start to trust too much in my unit tests. Several times I’ve
made changes to my code, crafted beautiful unit tests that provide 100%
assurance that the code is correct, only to have customers run into bugs
with the code. Apparently my 100% correct code has a margin of error.
Perhaps [Donald
Knuth](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth "Donald Knuth") [said
it
best](http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/faq.html "Knuth FAQ"),

> Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not
> tried it.

It’s surprisingly easy for this to happen. In one case, we had a UI
gesture bound to a method that was very well tested. Our UI was bound to
this method. All tests pass. Ship it!

Except when you actually execute the code, you find that there’s a
certain situation where an exception might occur that causes the code to
attempt to modify the UI on a thread other than the UI thread
*\#sadtrombone*. That’s tricky to catch in a unit test.

Getting Serious about Testing
-----------------------------

When I joined the GitHub for Windows (GHfW) team, we were still in the
spiking phase, constantly experimenting with the UI and code. We had
very little in the way of proper unit tests. Which worked fine for two
people working in the same code in the same room in San Francisco. But
here I was, the new guy hundreds of miles away in Bellevue, WA without
any of the context they had. So I started to institute more rigor in our
unit and integration tests as the product transitioned to a focus on
engineering.

But we still lacked rigor in regular non-automated testing. Then along
comes my compatriot, [Drew
Miller](https://twitter.com/halfogre "AnglicanGeek on Twitter"). If you
recall, he’s the one I cribbed my approach [structuring unit
tests](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/02/structuring-unit-tests.aspx/ "Structuring Unit Tests")
from.

Drew really gets testing in all its forms. I first started working with
him on the ASP.NET MVC team when he joined as a test lead. He switched
disciplines from a developer to become a QA person because he wanted a
venue to test this theories on testing and eventually show the world
that we don’t need separate QA person. Yes, he became a tester so he
could destroy the role, in order to save the practice.

In fact, he hates the term *QA* (which stands for *Quality Assurance*):

> The only assurance you will ever have is that code has bugs. Testing
> is about confidence. It's about generating confidence that the user's
> experience is good enough. And it's about feedback. It's about
> providing feedback to the developer in lieu of a user in the room. Be
> a tester, don't be QA.

On the GitHub for Windows team, we don’t have a tester. We’re all
responsible for testing. With Drew on board, we’re also getting much
better at it.

Testing Your Own Code and Cognitive Bias
----------------------------------------

There’s this common belief that developers shouldn’t test their own
code. Or maybe they should test it, but you absolutely need independent
testers to also test it as well. I used to fully subscribe to this idea.
But Drew has convinced me it’s hogwash.

It’s strange to me how developers will claim they can absolutely
architect systems, provide insights into business decisions, write code,
and do all sorts of things better than the suits and other co-workers,
but when it comes to testing. Oh no no no, I can’t do that!

I think it’s a myth we perpetuate because *we don’t like it*! Of course
we can do it, we’re smart and can do most anything we put our minds to.
We just *don’t want to* so we perpetuate this myth.

There is some truth that developers tend to be bad at testing their own
code. For example, the goal of a developer is to write software as bug
free as possible. The presence of a bug is a negative. And it’s human
nature to try to avoid things that make us sad. It’s very easy to
unconsciously ignore code paths we’re unsure of while doing our testing.

While a tester’s job is to find bugs. A bug is a good thing to these
folks. Thus they’re well suited to testing software.

But this oversimplifies our real goals as developers and testers. To
ship quality software. Our goals are not at odds. This is the mental
switch we must make.

And We Can Do It!
-----------------

After all, you’ve probably heard it said a million times, when you look
back on code written several months ago, you tend to cringe. You might
not even recognize it. Code in the brain has a short half-life. For me,
it only takes a day before code starts to slip my mind. In many
respects, when I approach code I wrote yesterday, it’s almost as if I’m
someone else approaching the code.

And that’s great for testing it.

When I think I’m done with a feature or a block of code, I pull a mental
trick. I mentally envision myself as a tester. My goal now is to find
bugs in this code. After all, if I find them and fix them first, nobody
else has to know. Whenever a customer finds a bug caused by me, I feel
horrible. So I have every incentive to try and break this code.

And I’m not afraid to ask for help when I need it. Sometimes it’s as
simple as brainstorming ideas on what to test.

One trick that my team has started doing that I really love is when a
feature is about done, we update the Pull Request (remember, a pull
request is a [conversation about some
code](https://github.com/blog/1124-how-we-use-pull-requests-to-build-github "How we use Pull Requests")
and you don’t have to wait for the code to be ready to merge to create a
PR) with a test plan using the [new Task Lists
feature](https://github.com/blog/1375-task-lists-in-gfm-issues-pulls-comments "Task Lists")
via [GitHub Flavored
Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/ "GHFM").

This puts me in a mindset to think about all the possible ways to break
the code. Some of these items might get pulled from our master test plan
or get added to it.

Here’s an example of a portion of a recent test plan for a major bug fix
I worked on (click on it to see it larger).

[![test-plan-in-pr](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Test-Better_9083/test-plan-in-pr_thumb.png "test-plan-in-pr")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Test-Better_9083/test-plan-in-pr_2.png)

The act of writing the test plan really helps me think hard about what
could go wrong with the code. Then running through it just requires
following the plan and checking off boxes. Sometimes as I’m testing,
I’ll think of new cases and I’ll just edit the plan accordingly.

Also, the test plan can serve as an indicator to others that the PR is
ready to be merged. When you see everything checked off, then it should
be good to go! Or if you want to be more explicit about it, add a
“sign-off” checkbox item. Whatever works best for you.

The Case for Testers
--------------------

Please don’t use this post to justify firing your test team. The point
I’m trying to make is that developers are capable of and should test
their own (and each others) code. It should be a badge of pride that
testers cannot find bugs in your code. But until you reach that point,
you’re probably going to need your test team to stick around.

While my team does not have dedicated testers, we consider each of us to
be testers. It’s a frame of mind we can put our minds into when we need
to.

But we’re also not building software for the Space Shuttle so maybe we
can get away with this.

I’m still of the mind that many teams can benefit from a dedicated
tester. But the role this person has is different from the traditional
rote mechanical testing you often find testers lumped into. This person
would mentor developers in the testing part of building software. Help
them get into that mindset. This person might also work to streamline
whatever crap gets in the way so that developers can better test their
code. For example, building automation that sets up test labs for
various configuration in a moment’s notice. Or helping to verify
incoming bug reports from customers.
