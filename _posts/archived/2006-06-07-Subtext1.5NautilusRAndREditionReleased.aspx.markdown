IMPORTANT UPDATE: There was a security bug in Subtext 1.5 for multiblog
setups that will allow the admin of one blog to login to another blog.
If you are only using a single blog setup, you have nothing to worry
about. For multiblog setups, please upgrade to Subtext 1.5.1. The change
is a single line change in `Subtext.Framework.dll` so if you have
already upgraded to Subtext 1.5, you can simply copy over the old
`Subtext.Framework.dll` file with the new one instead of copying every
file from the installation package. Sorry for the the inconvenience.
[Download Subtext
1.5.1](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896 "Subtext Downloads").

![Subtext Logo](http://haacked.com/images/SubtextLogo.png) After much
hard work, the Subtext team is proud to announce the release of [Subtext
1.5](http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896 "Download it"),
dubbed the Nautilus R&R Edition. This is primarily a bugfix release with
a load of bug fixes, but there are a couple of significant new features
as well as a bit of developer candy thrown in.

### Release Notes

Rather than list all the bug fixes and new features here, I will point
you to the [release notes published
online](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Roadmap/ReleaseNotes/tabid/146/Default.aspx "Subtext Release Notes").

I will point out a few key changes.

### HtmlEditorProvider

Subtext now supports an HtmlEditorProvider. You can swap out the html
editor used in the admin section by implementing a provider for your
editor of choice. Providers that ship with Subtext include the
FreeTextBoxProvider (default), FCKeditorProvider, and PlainTextProvider
for you angle bracket jockeys.

For more information on how to change the [text editor, read
this](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Developer/RichTextEditorConfiguration/tabid/144/Default.aspx "How to change the text editor").

### Javascript BlogInfo object

By default now, Subtext emits a javascript object useful for client
scripts to access information about the blog. This object is
intentionally simple, but may be expanded as needed. The variable name
for this object is `subtextBlogInfo`. The following is an example of its
usage.

```csharp
var imagesPath = subtextBlogInfo.getImagesVirtualRoot();
alert(imagesPath);
```

### Improved Skin configuration {.clear}

If you write custom skins, the `Skins.config` file has a few new
features. Here is a sample skin configuration that highlights several
new features.

```csharp
<SkinTemplate SkinID="Haackify" Skin="Haackify">
    <Scripts>
        <Script Src="~/Admin/Resources/Scripts/niceForms.js" />
        <Script Src="~/scripts/lightbox.js" />
        <Script Src="~/scripts/XFNHighlighter.js" />
        <Script Src="~/scripts/ExternalLinks.js" />
        <Script Src="~/scripts/LiveCommentPreview.js" />
        <Script Src="~/scripts/AmazonTooltips.js" />
    </Scripts>
    <Styles>
        <Style href="~/scripts/XFNHighlighter.css" />
        <Style href="~/scripts/lightbox.css" />
        <Style href="niceforms-default.css" />
        <Style href="print.css" media="print" />
    </Styles>
</SkinTemplate>
```

Notice that you can reference files using the tilde (\~) syntax. Subtext
now comes with several script files in the base `Scripts` directory that
can be shared across skins. For example, if you want to add the
[LightBox JS](http://huddletogether.com/projects/lightbox/ "LightboxJS")
effect to your skin, just reference the `~/scripts/lightbox.js` in the
`Script` section and the `~/scripts/lightbox.css` section in the `Style`
section as in the above example.

The root `Scripts` directory is a central repository for Subtext client
script files that are accessible to all skins. Typically skins will
include their own scripts. But occasionally the Subtext team will make
popular scripts available to all skins. Some of these scripts have been
modified to use the `subtextBlogInfo` object mentioned before.

Also notice that `Style` elements may now specifa a media. Thus you can
add a stylesheet to a skin specifically for printing.

### New Skins and Skin Controls

Checkout the new
*[Submarine](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/07/SubmarineSkin.aspx "Submarine")*
skin designed by our friends at
[TurboMilk](http://turbomilk.com/ "TurboMilk"). We have also added
several new skin controls such as the Previous Next control which
renders a link to the previous and next blog post. Note that not every
blog uses every skin control, but it is quite easy to add such a control
to the skin of your choice.

### CSS Based Printing

Nearly every skin in Subtext now implements CSS [based
printing](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/09/ImplementingCSSBasedPrinting.aspx "CSS Based Printing").

### Upgrading from Subtext 1.0

Subtext 1.5 has an automatic web-based upgrade wizard that will upgrade
your schema and stored procedures if you are currently running Subtext
1.0. We have made changes to web.config so if you have made any
customizations, you will need to merge these changes yourself which
should not be too hard. Please read the [upgrade
instructions](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Upgrading/tabid/147/Default.aspx "Upgrading Subtext to 1.5 from 1.0")
carefully before upgrading.

If you are uncomfortable upgrading your database schema automatically,
you can try the manual schema upgrade process [outlined
here](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Upgrading/ManualUpgradeProcess/tabid/148/Default.aspx "Manual Upgrade Process").
The steps in that process are the same ones that the automatic wizard
takes on your behalf.

### Installation

If you are installing Subtext for the first time, the web-based
installation works as before. Just follow the [instructions
here](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Installation/tabid/111/Default.aspx "Installing Subtext").

### Next Stop, Daedelus!

The next version of Subtext is code named **Daedelus**. It will simply
be a straight upgrade to ASP.NET 2.0. We hope for a quick turnaround as
we donâ€™t plan to add a lot of features in this iteration. We just want
to get up and running in ASP.NET 2.0. Afterwards we will start heavy
work on Subtext 2.0 **Poseidon**. This will be a more ambitious release.

Please note that we may introduce a lot of breaking changes for skins in
Subtext 2.0. We will try and keep you informed so that you will have
advanced warning on how to upgrade your custom skins.
