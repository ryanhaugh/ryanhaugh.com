Ok, I just have to take a moment to rant a bit. We’re currently looking
for some mid-level developers as well as a System Administrator.
Naturally we posted a job description on
[Dice.com](http://www.dice.com/ "Dice") and
[craigslist.org](http://www.craigslist.org/ "Craigs List"). In general I
find the best candidates through referral, but occasionaly I’ll get a
few good ones through a job site.

If the crop of resumes and cover letters I received is a fair indication
of the quality of developer job applicants out there (and I hope and
believe this is not the case), then either the U.S. developer population
is nearly fully employed (in which case I’m cool), or outsourcing to
offshore countries is starting to make a lot of sense.

So let’s start of with an episode of:

Haacked.com’s 4 Tips For Job Seekers

**1. Your cover letter and resume should be an example of the best work
you can do.** \
 Initially, I have absolutely nothing to judge you by except your resume
and cover letter. So take the time to get it right. If you’re applying
to be a system administrator and you spell *virus* as *viurs*, I have to
wonder if you’ll take the same care with our production servers.

If you are a developer, don’t tell me *I spend 5 years working ASP.NET
sites.* Try to squeeze a preposition in there. I get absolutely giddy
with joy when I receive a cover letter that is concise and well written.
Compared to the other gruft I get, a well written cover letter is page
gripper. I’ll take it to the beach and read it over and over.

**2. Learn to use a spell-checker and have someone else proof-read your
resume.** \
 As a developer, I understand that a spell checker chokes on the line
where you list your skills as

> Expert in C\#/C++/C/PERL/J++/WMD/ASP.NET/Stamp
> Collecting/Java/J2EE/Oracle/Cisco/SQL/Table
> tennis/Chess/Jai-Alai/Math/

But you’re supposed to be a problem solver. Figure it out. If your
resume has obvious spelling and grammar errors, it reflects poorly on
yourself (see tip \#1).

**3. Provide working and professional contact info**\
 I kid you not, I received a resume with the email address
*WatchYoBack@[Domain Witheld].com*.

Trust me, I’ll do exactly that by not calling you. In this particular
situation I didn’t notice the email address and tried to call the
applicant. Both his cell number and land line were disconnected.
Apparently you didn’t watch yo phone bills.

I can’t imagine what would compel you to send me a resume with phone
numbers that don’t work.

And why use such an email address when you can create one for free. It
doesn’t have to be your name. It can be something obtuse or abstract.
But I’d recommend against threatening people to watch their back in your
email.

Another applicant had an email address where the domain name is slang
for sexual intercourse. Something to do with uglies. That one I found
funny, but would not recommend it as not everyone shares my sense of
humor.

**4. Lastly, do provide an updated resume** \
 I was speaking to one candidate and he started talking about recent
employers that I could not find on his resume. His last job listed ended
in 2003. When I asked about this discrepancy, he apologized and said
that he hasn’t updated his resume in a while. That’s odd I thought, I
downloaded this resume off his website like he asked me to. There were
two links, one for a resume as a Word document and one for a resume as a
PDF.

Apparently neither of those resumes were updated. I was supposed to
click on a tab of his website with the word *experience* and look at his
HTML formatted resume. Are you trying NOT to find a job? Do us all a
favor, send a nicely formatted resume when you apply for the job, or
don’t apply at all.

* * * * *

That’s it. Only four. I don’t have time to tell you how to look for a
job. Besides, I think Joel Spolsky did a fine job in [this
article](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/ResumeRead.html). You
might be quite qualified, but you’ve disqualified yourself by using poor
English, bad spelling, and general inability to communicate well.
Undoubtedly I’m preaching to the choir. But if you know people looking
for a job, remind them of these four tips.

And with that, I end my rant. Have a nice weekend everybody.
