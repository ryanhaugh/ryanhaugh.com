posts about finding Google phrases that return your site at \#1 with
more than 100 results.

Because we geeks have nothing better to do and have a deep seated need
for the validation that only Google can provide, I checked my referrer
logs and came up with the following three phrases.

Also, before you mistakenly read the third option, it's spelled with an
"A" not an "E". It's a skit on Dave Chappelle's (a hilarious comedian)
show about a white "Harriet and Ozzie" family in the 50s with an
unfortunate last name.

Google ego boosting challenge \#2, find a search phrase on
[images.google.com](http://images.google.com/i "images.google.com") that
brings up your picture. A bit tougher...
