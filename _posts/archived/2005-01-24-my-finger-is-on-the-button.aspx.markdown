If you’re a fan of good music (I mean objectively, not subjectively) I
plan to recommend a few songs here and there in this blog. Never mind
the fact that if you end up purchasing the songs via my site, I get
paid. I give you my word, a vow, that I will never lead you musically
astray. I may lead you astray in other ways, but not in music.

Having said that, let me introduce you to this new single by [The
Chemical Brothers](http://www.thechemicalbrothers.com/).

I’m a big fan of Metropolis on [KCRW](http://www.kcrw.com/). If you live
in the Los Angeles area and are a fan of good music then you’re probably
familiar with this radio show hosted by Jason Bentley. It’s a great
place for discovering new music as Jason really does have his finger on
the pulse of electronica and world music.

It’s on this show that I first heard the song Galvanize, which contains
the catchy hook that is the subject of this post, "My finger is on the
button". I purchased it on
[![Galvanize](http://ax.phobos.apple.com.edgesuite.net/images/badgeitunes61x15dark.gif)](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=Ety/Ew7*IZs&offerid=78941&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=http%253A%252F%252Fphobos.apple.com%252FWebObjects%252FMZStore.woa%252Fwa%252FviewAlbum%253FselectedItemId%253D41499299%2526playListId%253D41499321%2526originStoreFront%253D143441%26partnerId%3D30)
today and am totally digging the violin action mixed in with the funky
beats. The image on the left is a deep link into the iTunes music store.
