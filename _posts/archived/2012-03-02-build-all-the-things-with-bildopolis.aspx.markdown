Recently I’ve been tweeting photos of my kids playing with a new toy my
wife bought them that ~~I’m~~they are totally enthralled with. It’s
called the [Bildopolis](http://bildopolis.com/ "Bildopolis") Big Bilder
Kit.

This is a creation of a family friend of ours who used to be an
industrial designer at IDEO. He left a while ago to start on his own
thing and came up with this. We bought a set immediately in part to to
support his efforts, but also because it looked cool. We were not
disappointed. This thing is fun.

The concept is really simple. It’s a set of cardboard squares,
triangles, and rectangles that have “female” velcro semicircles
attached. Those are the white parts in the photos. The kit also comes
with a bag of colorful “male” velcro “dots”.

Apply the dots to attach the cardboard pieces together to make all sorts
of interesting structures for your kids to play in. If your kids are
older, they’ll probably want to build their own structures.

I want to make it clear that I don’t get any kickbacks or anything and
we paid full price for our set. I’m just pimping this out because I had
so much fun building stuff with it and my kids really love it. Maybe
yours will too.

In one evening, we built about four different structures. They’re quick
and flexible to build.

There are a few downsides though. The Haackerdome below is probably
going to be a permanent fixture in our living room, which takes up a bit
of space. Also, these structures are meant for playing inside of, not on
top of. They wouldn’t be sturdy enough to support the weight of kids
climbing on top of them.

[![haackerdome](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Build-All-The-Things-With-Bildopolis_140B5/haackerdome_thumb.jpg "haackerdome")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Build-All-The-Things-With-Bildopolis_140B5/haackerdome_2.jpg)

In any case, if you want to learn more, check out the [Bildopolis
website](http://bildopolis.com/ "Bildopolis"). They have a video showing
off the kit. There’s [also a
gallery](http://bildopolis.com/bildopolis2011/gallery2012.php "Bildopolis Gallery")
where folks have sent in photos of what they’ve built. That’s where I
got the idea for the dome. The kit sells for \$80 not including
shipping.
