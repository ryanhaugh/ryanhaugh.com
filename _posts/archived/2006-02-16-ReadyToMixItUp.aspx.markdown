![Mix 06](http://haacked.com/images/MixLogo.jpg) Well I am ready to mix
it up at the [Mix 06 conference](http://mix06.com/ "Mix 06 Conference").
This will be my first conference of the year and my coworker [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway's Blog") will
also be in attendance.

I do have one big concern. The conference is in Las Vegas. This is like
a kid sitting in a class lecture held in a candy store. I have already
registered, so at least thereâ€™s no risk of me trying to double my
registration fees at the craps table.

While there I will see if I can pencil in BillG for a conversation about
supporting web standards with the next generation of Microsoft tools for
the web.

Anybody have any inexpensive hotel recommendations?
