There’s [a great
interview](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/2008/04/08/interview-with-brad-wilson-software-developer-officelabs-microsoft/ "Interview with Brad Wilson")
on the [How Software is
Built](http://howsoftwareisbuilt.com/ "How Software is Built") blog with
[Brad Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson"), a developer
in Microsoft’s OfficeLabs team, but probably better known for his work
on xUnit.net, CodePlex, and ObjectBuilder.

What I particularly liked about this post was the insight Brad provides
on the diverse views of open source outside and inside of Microsoft as
well as his own personal experience contributing to many OSS projects.
It’s hard for some to believe, but there are developers internal to
Microsoft who like and contribute to various open source projects.

Another reason that Brad gets a thumbs up in my book (along with [Jim
Newkirk](http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/ "Jim's Blog")) is that
[xUnit.net recently updated their
installer](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2008/04/xunitnet-rc2--1.html "xUnit.net RC2 Refresh")
to include [test project
integration](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/02/12/asp.net-mvc-update.aspx "Test project integration with ASP.NET MVC")
with ASP.NET MVC Preview 2.
