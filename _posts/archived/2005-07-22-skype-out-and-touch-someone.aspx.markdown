![Skype](http://haacked.com/images/skype.png) My wife usually uses a
cheap calling card to call her mother in Japan. Unfortunately, for the
last month, every time she would try to call, there would be problems.
Today for example, they were having problems routing calls and she kept
waking up some man in god only knows what god forsaken country he was
in.

I suggested she finally give [Skype](http://www.skype.com/) a try and
she’s now downstairs on her iBook chatting with her mom. Since her mom
doesn’t have a computer, she’s using the [Skype
Out](http://www.skype.com/products/skyeout/) service which is still much
cheaper than using the phone.

I don’t exactly know why, but I find this use of computers and software
so interesting and compelling. Part of it is the simple enjoyment of
seeing how technology can foster community and communication. But more
personally, it is also the excitement of seeing software and technology
that I am excited about that my wife can also enjoy and be excited
about. Most of the time my excitement for technology falls on deaf ears.

Reach out and Skype someone.

*I just read what I wrote up there and it sounds just like a Skype ad.
Hey Skype! Pay me! ;)*
