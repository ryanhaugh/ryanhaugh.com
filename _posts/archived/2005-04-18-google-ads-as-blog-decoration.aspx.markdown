Since I [mentioned that the Family
Guy](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/08/2602.aspx) was no longer
cancelled on my blog, I've noticed that Google Ad Sense has been
displaying a Family Guy banner ad on my [homepage](http://haacked.com/).

![Family Guy](/images/familyGuy.gif) In case it is gone by the time you
read this, the image at left is a snippet from the full banner ad. It's
colorful and looks rather nice at the top of my blog.

Now I agree that it's a bad idea to try to game the google AdSense
system for profit, but what about gaming the system for pure fun? For
example, coaxing the Google Ad-Sense system to display the most
interesting (or offensive) ad possible.

Well I won't condone such behavior lest I'm removed from the program. I
will merely mention the idea.
