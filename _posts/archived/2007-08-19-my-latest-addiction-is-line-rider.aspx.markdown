Not too long ago, [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror") lowered the
overall productivity of software developers everywhere when he [wrote
about Desktop Tower
Defense](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000872.html "How to get rich programming"),
a game that he calls *fiendishly addictive*.

I chose not to play the game as I had too much going on. But now I have
family visiting and my brother (Hey Brian!) introduced me to yet another
fiendishly addictive flash game, *[Line
Rider](http://www.official-linerider.com/images/engin2.162.swf "Line Rider").
Damn you brother!*

It’s not even really a game in the sense that there’s no objective other
than to build really cool courses. It’s quite similar to a physics
drawing tool. You simply start drawing lines and hit play to watch a
some little dude with a red scarf sled down your course.

The tools themselves are simple. You have a free-hand pencil tool and a
line tool. There are 3 colors of lines you can draw.

-   Blue - Draws a line where the sledder can sled at a normal pace.
-   Red - Draws a line that accelerates the sledder.
-   Green - Draws a line that doesn’t affect the sledder.

Using this simple set of tools, you can create some very interesting
courses across a limitless canvas.

I was quite pleased with myself for executing a loop-de-loop until my
brother showed me some of the amazing stuff that people have put
together on YouTube like these two videos:

Sadly, I am completely hooked.
