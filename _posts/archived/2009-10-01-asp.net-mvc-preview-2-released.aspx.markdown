Today we just released ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 2 for Visual Studio 2008
SP1 (and ASP.NET 3.5 SP1), which builds on top of the work we did in
[Preview 1 released two months
ago](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/07/30/asp.net-mvc-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1 Released").

-   [Download
    Page](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154414 "Download ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 2")
-   [Release
    Notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157066 "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 2 Release Notes")
-   [Roadmap](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Road%20Map&referringTitle=Home "Roadmap")
-   [Source Code and Futures on
    CodePlex](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=33836 "Source Code on CodePlex") 

Some of the cool new features we’ve added to Preview 2 include:

-   **Client-Side Validation** – ASP.NET MVC 2 includes the [jQuery
    validation
    library](http://bassistance.de/jquery-plugins/jquery-plugin-validation/ "jQuery Validation")
    to provide client-side validation based on the model’s validation
    metadata. It is possible to hook in alternative client-side
    validation libraries by writing an adapter which adapts the client
    library to the JSON metadata in a manner similar to the [xVal
    validation
    framework](http://xval.codeplex.com/ "xVal Validation Framework on CodePlex").
-   **Areas** – Preview 2 includes in-the-box support for single project
    areas for developers who wish to organize their application without
    requiring multiple projects. Registration of areas has also been
    streamlined.
-   **Model Validation Providers** - allow hooking in alternative
    validation logic to provide validation when model binding. The
    default validation providers uses Data Annotations.
-   **Metadata Providers** - allow hooking in alternative sources of
    metadata for model objects. The default metadata provider uses Data
    Annotations.

Based on this list, you’ll notice a theme where in Preview 1, we tied
much functionality directly to Data Annotation attributes, in Preview 2
we inserted abstractions around our usage of Data Annotations which
allow hooking in custom implementations of validation and metadata
providers.

This will allow you to do things like swapping out our default
validation with the Enterprise Library Validation Block for example. It
also allows providing implementations where model metadata is stored in
alternative locations rather than via attributes, with a bit of work.

### What About Visual Studio 2010?

The tools for this particular release only work in Visual Studio 2008
SP1. The version of ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 2 for Visual Studio 2010 will
be released in-the-box with Visual Studio 2010 Beta 2. You won’t need to
go anywhere else, it’ll just be there waiting for you. Likewise, the RTM
of ASP.NET MVC 2 will be included with the RTM of Visual Studio 2010.

Therefore, if you want to try out the new [HTML encoding code
blocks](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/09/25/html-encoding-code-nuggets.aspx "HTML Encoding Code Blocks")
with ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 2, you’ll have to wait till Visual Studio
2010 Beta 2 is released. But for now, you can try out Preview 2 on VS
2008 and start [providing
