I got a [1099](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099 "IRS Tax Form")
for my blog yesterday. Now that is a weird feeling. Google giveth, the
federal government taketh away.

Google has some [tax information regarding ad-sense
income](https://www.google.com/adsense/taxinfo "Google Adsense Tax Information").
Basically operating this blog has in effect become a small
proprietorship small business. I will deduct hosting costs etc... I
wonder if I can deduct time spent on
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website"). That
would be pretty sweet.

UPDATE: For my readers not familiar with tax regulations in the U.S., I
should mention that the
[1099](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Form_1099 "IRS Tax Form") is used to
report income other than wages, salaries, and tips. I linked to the
[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/ "Wikipedia Online Encyclopedia")
explanation for more details.
