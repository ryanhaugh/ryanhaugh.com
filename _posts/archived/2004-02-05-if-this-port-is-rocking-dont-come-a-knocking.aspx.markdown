[\>Port knocking](http://www.portknocking.org/) is a method of
establishing extra security between a networked computer and the outside
world. It seems like a great idea. For hosts that are running private
services that need to be connected to the net, require clients to make a
specific series of connection attempts to various ports. After the
correct sequence is made, the firewall opens up the port for the client.
This would be very difficult to uncover via a port scan.
