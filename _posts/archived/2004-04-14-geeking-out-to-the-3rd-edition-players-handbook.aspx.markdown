![](/images/PlayersHandbook.jpg) DISCLAIMER: When I say Player's
handbook, I'm not talking about a "Playa's Handbook". The book I am
referencing is absolutely the WRONG thing to read if you want to pick up
chicks. I'm already married, so I can bring this stuff out.

So after a long three day weekend of moving, I decided that I needed to
geek out to the Dungeons and Dragons Player's Handbook 3rd edition that
I borrowed from Micah. I played the second edition rules when I was a
kid and have a lot of nostalgia associated with the game. I thought it
would be fun to take a look at the new rules.

So far, the theme appears to be simplification. I like the fact that
they've simplified the experience point table. Now, instead of each
class having a separate table for advancement, everyone uses the same
table. Multiclassing is simplified as well. I always thought that
certain rules were overly complex. On one hand, that is fun in the "ooh,
I like secrets" sort of way. But on the other hand, it led to too many
"what fucking die do I roll!?" moments.
