This [post about crosswalk
countdowns](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/crosswalk_countdowns_and_icons.php)
and icons reminds me of the crosswalk icon in Bilbao.

As I mentioned in my [highlights from Spain
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/29/11266.aspx), Bilbao seems to
have embraced design since the Guggenheim was built. One example of this
is their crosswalk lights. Not only is there a countdown, but the
crosswalk icon itself is animated, showing a person walking. However, as
the countdown gets closer to zero, the animated figure starts to run,
not walk.

Cool!
