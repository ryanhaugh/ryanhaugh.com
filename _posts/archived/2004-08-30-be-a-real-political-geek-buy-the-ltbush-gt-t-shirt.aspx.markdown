In the comments section of the post about [the geekiest protest
sign](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/30/987.aspx),
[Clara](http://www.mismatched.net.nz/clara/index.html) points out that
[tshirthell.com](http://www.tshirthell.com/) sells a [t-shirt with the
end Bush tag](http://www.tshirthell.com/shirts/tshirt.php?sku=a335)
(seen below).

Tell them Haacked sent ya (not that I know those people).

As to the question whether this is XHTML, HTML, XML, SGML compliant? Who
really gives a flying fuck? I mean c'mon people, get a freakin' life!
The real question is why choose a serif font over a sans-serif? ;)

For you real geeks: 0x3c 0x2F 0x62 0x75 0x73 0x68 0x3E

UPDATE: Oh, and this shirt is an XHTML compliant end tag (unlike the
protest sign) assuming it is preceded by a start tag. According to
[Section 4.2](http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/#h-4.2) of the W3C
recommendation, Element and attribute names must all be in lowercase.
