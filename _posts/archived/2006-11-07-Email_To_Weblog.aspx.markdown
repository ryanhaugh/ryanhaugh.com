[Telligent](http://telligent.com/ "Telligent"), the hyper-caffeinated
people behind [Community
Server](http://communityserver.org/ "Community Server"), have just
released their latest online service,
[blogmailr](http://blogmailr.com/ "Blog Mailer").  This service allows
you to post to your blog via email.

Leading up to the unveiling, the Telligenti have been a bit coy about
keeping this product shrouded in secrecy.  But with a name like
blogmailr, removing the last “e” isn’t quite obfuscating enough to
prevent anyone from guessing. ;)

We’ve been working on a mail-to-weblog feature for
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website"), but if
you can’t wait for that, you can always give blogmailr a try.  I gave it
a quick try and it does indeed work with Subtext. One nice feature of
the service is that they support [Really Simple
Discovery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Really_Simple_Discovery "RSD")
(RSD), popularized by Windows Live Writer, so it is easy to configure.

If you are a fanatic about clean valid semantic markup, you should
consider sending your email using plain text.  All the markup gunk that
Outlook puts in for rich text emails will make your
[validator’s](http://validator.w3.org/ "HTML Validator") head spin. 
After posting this very blog post with BlogMailr, I went in and cleaned
up the markup.  I’m just anal that way.

If this service takes off, beware of spammers attempting to email random
blocks of \*@blogmailr.com email addresses.  That would be a
particularly effective SPAM attack if they were able to post to your
blog via email.

Fortunately, the service generates a random email address used to post
to your blog.  It also allows you to specify which email addresses it
will accept as a from address.  So a spammer would have to spoof
your allowed address and guess your blogmailr address.  Not easily
accomplished.

One downside of this approach is it may be difficult for users to
remember the generated blogmailr email address.
