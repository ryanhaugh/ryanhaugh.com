At the end of the year, it’s very common for bloggers to take a look
back at their own blog and list their favorite 10 blog posts. I find
that somewhat narcissistic, so you know I’m going to do that.

But before I do, I thought it would be great to list the top 10 blog
posts by others I read in 2008. The only problem is, I have very bad
short-term memory and I can’t seem to remember which ones I read that
had a real impact on my thinking. I’ll have to try and keep better track
in 2009.

So based on a cursory Google search and look through my Google Reader
app, here are some of my favorite blog posts of 2008 by you all, I
couldn’t even list 10. Please do comment with your own favorite blog
posts, mine or otherwise of 2008.

Favorite Posts I Read
---------------------

-   [IT Industry Revolutionised by Labour Saving
    Device](http://secretgeek.net/self_click_next.asp "Labour Saving Device")
    This one is pure comedy gold by Leon Bambrick, aka SecretGeek.
-   [jQuery and
    Microsoft](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx "jQuery and Microsoft")
    A short post, but the significance of what the post indicates is
    more momentous than the post itself.
-   [On Our Project, We’re always 90%
    Done](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001161.html "Always 90% Done")
    What top list would be complete without a
    [CodingHorror](http://codinghorror.com/) link. It was hard to
    choose, but this one feels very appropriate to where I am right now.
-   [The Greatest Invention in Computer
    Science](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001129.html "The Greatest Invention in Computer Science")
    Another Atwood blog post. If I were to name the one blog that was my
    favorite in 2008, it would be his.
-   [Powerful CSS-Techniques For Effective
    Coding](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2008/02/21/powerful-css-techniques-for-effective-coding/ "Powerful CSS-Techniques for Effective Coding")
    Not necessarily an impactful post, but extremely useful and one I
    reference often.
-   [The Single Most Important Thing You Must Do To Improve Your
    Programming
    Career](http://weblog.raganwald.com/2008/04/single-most-important-thing-you-must-do.html "Improve your career")
    Great advice from Raganwald, aka Reg Braithwaite.
-   [XKCD – Real
    Programmers](http://xkcd.com/378/ "XCD - Real Programmers") And for
    good measure, an XKCD comic.

My Top Posts (Using the [Ayende Formula](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/09/Calculating-most-popular-posts-with-SubText.aspx "Calculating most popular posts with Subtext"))
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A while back, Ayende wrote up a weighted query for
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") to
determine the top posts. I updated it to only include mine published in
2008. Here are the top 5.

-   [Is Pizza Brain
    Food?](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/21/is-pizza-brain-food.aspx "Is Pizza Brain Food")
    A musing on whether Pizza was the source of my ability to absorb new
    information in college.
-   [Everything You Wanted To Know About MVC and MVP But Were Afraid To
    Ask](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/06/16/everything-you-wanted-to-know-about-mvc-and-mvp-but.aspx)
    Title says it all.
-   [Back From Mix Back To
    Reality](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/08/back-from-mix-back-to-reality.aspx)
    Surprisingly, my post on the Mix conference was in the top three. I
    think this means the quality of my blog has declined.
-   [Updated Northwind Demo For ASP.NET MVC
    Beta](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/05/23/updated-northwind-demo.aspx)
    Seems like a lot of people want to see simple samples for [ASP.NET
    MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website").
-   [Thoughts on ASP.NET MVC Preview 2 and
    Beyond](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/10/thoughts-on-asp.net-mvc-preview-2-and-beyond.aspx)

Milestones Moments
------------------

There are some posts that I personally liked because they represent
important events that happened to me in 2008.

-   [So Long L.A. And Thanks For All The
    Fish](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/01/04/so-long-l.a.-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish.aspx)
    It was in January of this year that my family and I left Los
    Angeles. This post was my homage to Los Angeles, with plenty of
    photos.
-   [What happened to You’ve Been
    HAACKED?](http://www.lostechies.com/blogs/sean_chambers/archive/2008/02/26/what-happened-to-you-ve-been-haacked.aspx "What happened?")
    Someone out there (well just Sean Chambers) cares enough to call me
    out for the declining quality of my blog. My god, he was right! It
    was a wake up call and I hope to improve in 2009.
-   [ASP.NET MVC: A New Framework for Building Web
    Applications](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/15/stackoverflow-at-pdc.aspx "PDC Talk")
    I gave my first PDC talk ever with [Jeff
    Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "Jeff Atwood's Blog") who talked
    briefly about
    [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow"). It was
    great fun! While at PDC, I discovered a [new presentation
    tip](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/15/stackoverflow-at-pdc.aspx "Hot New Presentation Tip").
-   [Subtext 2.1 Released! Contains Security
    Update](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/27/subtext-2.1-security-update.aspx)
    After a long hiatus, we finally produced two more releases of
    Subtext one after the other.
-   [ASP.NET MVC Beta
    Released!](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/10/16/aspnetmvc-beta-release.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Beta")
    We finally got the first Beta for ASP.NET MVC.

Ok, so maybe this post is pretty typical and doesn’t live up to the
title I gave it. Oh well, I tried.

I’m sure I’m forgetting a whole lot of other important events that
happened in 2008. I’m probably neglecting great blog posts that I read.
But that’s the great thing about a blog, I’m confident people will point
out my shortcomings in the comments to this post, and for that, I’m
grateful. You all rock!

And with that, I leave you with this moment of zen, a photo taken near
my house.
