I'm chatting with my buddy Micah who will ask me a question and then
annoyingly answer it himself immediately after. For example, he asked me
how FireFox picks up an icon from web pages. I replied that there's a
favicon protocol but that I didn't know the details. He then proceeded
to explain how to format the link tag properly.

Apparently the latest version of Trillian will highlight words with
links to their definition in Wikipedia. So as you chat with your
friends, you become a living breathing dictionary. That's a rather nice
feature for IM conversations.
