So after reading [this post by Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/FaceRecognitionuhNotQuite.aspx "Face Recognition Blog Post"),
I just had to try it out. He writes about a site called
[MyHeritage](http://www.myheritage.com/ "My Heritage Website") that
attempts to match your face to celebrities and relatives.

I thought I might have interesting results since I am bi-racial, but
wasn’t expecting much. Here is the photo I uploaded and the two closest
look alikes.

Now that is just plain rude! Dare I play the race card here? Just
because I am half-Korean with glasses doesn’t mean I look like Kim Jong
Il! We don’t all look alike!

In a way they were accurate about my heritage, by having the top two
results be a caucasian and a Korean.

Now if you’ll excuse me, the Great Leader wishes to get back to work on
some interesting code.
