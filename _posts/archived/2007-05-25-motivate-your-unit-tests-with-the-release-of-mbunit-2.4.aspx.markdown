Are your unit tests a little flat lately? Have they lost their shine and
seem a bit directionless? Maybe it’s time to jazz ’em up a bit with the
[latest release of
MbUnit](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/archive/2007/05/24/mbunit-2-4-rtm.aspx "MbUnit 2.4 RTM").

Andrew Stopford posted a list of bug fixes, improvements, and new
features. The new feature I’m selfishly excited about is the new
Attribute that can [Extract an Embedded
Resource](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/04/27/extract-embedded-resources-with-an-attribute-in-mbunit.aspx "Extract Embedded Resources With An Attribute").
Finally, I have a patch submitted to MbUnit! :)

MbUnit has changed the way I write unit tests. Here’s a list of a few of
my posts on MbUnit.

-   [Specialized Assertion
    Classes](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/10/productive-unit-testing-with-specialized-assertion-classes-in-mbunit.aspx "Productive Unit Testing with Specialized Assertion Classes")
-   [Row-based Testing in
    MbUnit](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/20/Row_Based_Testing.aspx "Row Based Testing")
-   [Switching to
    MbUnit](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/10/18/SwitchingToMbUnit.aspx "Switching to MbUnit")

Now go and robustify your application.
