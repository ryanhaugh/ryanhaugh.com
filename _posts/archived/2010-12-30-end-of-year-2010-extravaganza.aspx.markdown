It’s the end of the year and it’s time for the annual year in review
blog post. I know what you’re thinking, but don’t worry, you remembered
to turn off the stove before leaving.

You’re also probably thinking, “do we really need an end of year blog
post from everyone?”. I asked on [Quora](http://quora.com/ "Quora"), and
the answer is a definitive no, we don’t. This is my absolutely
**unnecessary** self indulgent end of year blog post. I wouldn’t have it
any other way, would you?

I didn’t want to settle with an ordinary “Ho hum bore you to tears 2010
Year in Review Blog Post”. Mainly because I hate to see you cry. Really.
Please stop. What I wanted was nothing short of nuclear supernova
fireworks, dancing panda bears, and double rainbow fish that shoot
sparks out their butts. In short, a blow your monocle off spectacular
end of year review blog post!

Unfortunately, I waited too long and everybody was booked. So all I
could get was this dancing panda.

This has been a great but somewhat crazy year for me. It’s kind of
insane to think that in the same year we released the RTM for ASP.NET
MVC 2, we also released not one, but count ‘em, two release candidates
for ASP.NET MVC 3!

Also in this year, we started a new open source package manager,
[NuGet](http://nuget.codeplex.com/ "NuGet Package Manager"), which
*accepts external contributions*. My how the pendulum swings over here.

What I Liked In 2010
--------------------

2010 presented me with a lot of things to like.

-   **Podcast:** In general, I feel the same way [Scott Hanselman feels
    about
    Podcasts](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PodcastingVerbalIncontinence.aspx "Podcasting == Verbal Incontinence")
    when he said “Sorry folks, PodCasting = Verbal Incontinence.  I'm
    just not feeling it.” This makes for delicious irony that he’s
    involved in my favorite podcast of 2010, [This Developer’s
    Life](http://thisdeveloperslife.com/ "This Developer's Life").
    Started by friend [Rob
    Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery's Blog"), I describe
    it as focusing on the more human side of software and it’s pretty
    much the only podcast I subscribe to.
-   **Video:** [RSA Animate – Drive: The surprising truth about what
    motivates
    us](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u6XAPnuFjJc&feature=player_embedded "Motivation").
    I absolutely love how this video uses a unique animation style to
    present on the topic of motivation.
-   **Book:** I didn’t read a lot of books in 2010, but one that stood
    out was [Rocket Surgery Made Easy: The Do-It-Yourself Guide to
    Finding and Fixing Usability
    Problems](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321657292?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321657292 "Rocket Surgery Made Easy on Amazon.com"),
    which is Steve Krug’s worthy follow-up to [Don’t Make Me
    Think](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0321344758/youvebeenhaac-20 "Don't Make Me Think").
    You owe it to the users of your software to read and absorb these
    books.
-   **Blog:** Nothing really did it for me this year. As always, I
    enjoyed [CodingHorror](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror"), but
    I found a read a much wider variety of blog posts due to Twitter and
    unfortunately didn’t remember to bookmark my favorite of the year.
    I’ll try better next year.
    ![Smile](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/wlEmoticon-smile_2.png)
-   **Gadgets:** This is a tie between my iPhone 4 and my
    [Kinect](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002BSA298?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002BSA298 "Kinect on Amazon.com").
    I am on my phone all the time. Perhaps too much. Ok, definitely too
    much. I now have a WP7 Samsung Focus at home, but I haven’t had any
    time to play with it yet. We recently got a Kinect and I am totally
    hooked on [Dance
    Central](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002I0HBOI?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B002I0HBOI "Dance Central").
    The part that really hooked me is that they show where your score
    ranks among the scores of your friends on X-Box live after each
    dance. I’m determined to destroy my friends with my fresh moves.
-   **My Kids:**Seriously, they’re cool! (I like my wife too, but she
    doesn’t like her picture plastered on the web. My kids get no
    choice.) ![Winking
    smile](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)[![Me-and-the-kids](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/Me-and-the-kids_thumb_1.jpg "Me-and-the-kids")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/Me-and-the-kids_4.jpg)

Memorable Moments/Trips of 2010
-------------------------------

Here are some memorable moments from 2010 that I happened to blog about.
I’m sure there are many others memorable moments I forgot to blog about.

-   **February** I [visited Austin Texas for the first
    time](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/02/28/austin-texas-great-for-geeks.aspx "Visiting Austin").
    I spoke at the Austin .NET User Group as well as at Dell and enjoyed
    the fine taste of Rudy’s BBQ. I spent every moment reminding Texans
    that if Alaska were split in half to make two states, Texas would be
    the third largest state in the union.
-   **March** We [released ASP.NET MVC
    2](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/11/aspnet-mvc2-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM")
    which was shortly followed with the [source code release of
    System.Web.Mvc.dll](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/12/ms-pl-source-release-for-system-web-mvc-2.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Source Code")
    under the Ms-PL license. I was allowed exactly two breaths of relief
    before getting started on ASP.NET MVC 3. In the same month, I
    [attended the Mix 10
    conference](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/22/good-times-and-vibes-at-mix-10.aspx "Good times at Mix 10")
    in Las Vegas and met [John
    Resig](http://ejohn.org/ "John Resig's Blog") and [Douglas
    Crockford](http://www.crockford.com/ "Douglas Crockford's Website")
    for the first time. I gave two talks, one of them co-presented with
    [Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog")
    which is always a good time.
-   **April** I [attempted an April Fool’s
    joke](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/31/a-new-closed-source-viral-license.aspx "Closed Source Viral License").
    I’ve been told many times I should leave comedy to the experts, but
    I don’t see the fun in that.
-   **June** The Subtext team and I [released version 2.5 of
    Subtext](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/06/06/subtext-2-5-released.aspx "Subtext 2.5 released!").
    The pace of work on Subtext has really slowed down as work has kept
    me busier and busier, but we’re still improving it and getting
    closer to another release. Also in June, I [took my son to
    Alaska](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/06/27/back-from-alaska.aspx "Alaska Trip")
    to visit his grandparents as a little vacation. While there, I spoke
    at the Alaska .NET User Group. No moose were in attendance.
-   **July** We released the [first preview of ASP.NET MVC
    3](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/07/27/aspnetmvc3-preview1-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 Released").
    This was the first public disclosure of the new streamlined Razor
    syntax for views. Nobody was cut in the process.
-   **August** After a five year absence, I [returned to Black Rock
    City](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/08/29/attention-denizens-of-black-rock-city.aspx "Attention Denizens of Black Rock City")
    for the Burning Man festival. As best as I can tell, I did not die
    while there.
-   **September**I [presented at Web Camp
    L.A](http://www.jamessenior.com/2010/09/16/web-camp-la-trip-report-2/ "Web Camp LA Trip Report").
    In the evening, I visited my old friends and we went curling. Yeah,
    seriously.
-   **October** We publicly [announced the NuGet package
    manager](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/10/06/introducing-nupack-package-manager.aspx "Introducing NuGet")
    project (it was initially called NuPack). This was a project I had
    been working on at the same time as ASP.NET MVC 3. To me, this
    project was very significant as it’s an open source project that
    accepts external contributions! But don’t worry, we also reject some
    too.
-   **December** We [released the second release
    candidate](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/12/10/asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate-2.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 RC 2")
    for ASP.NET MVC 3.

My Top 3 Posts (Using the [Ayende Formula](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/09/Calculating-most-popular-posts-with-SubText.aspx "Ayende Formula"))
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

With Subtext 2.5, the [Ayende
Formula](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/09/Calculating-most-popular-posts-with-SubText.aspx "Calculating popular blog posts with Subtext"),
as we call it, is now integrated into the Subtext admin dashboard which
makes compiling this list very easy!

Interestingly enough, this list doesn’t correspond to the posts that I
think are most interesting. But that’s typically the case. I have bad
taste.

-   [ASP.NET MVC 2 Optional URL
    Parameters](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/02/12/asp-net-mvc-2-optional-url-parameters.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Optional URL Parameters")
    Covers using `UrlParameter.Optional` for optional Routing
    paramreters in ASP.NET MVC 2 (*36 comments, 40,542 Web views, 23,818
    aggregator views*).
-   [Sending JSON to an ASP.NET MVC Action Method
    Argument](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/04/15/sending-json-to-an-asp-net-mvc-action-method-argument.aspx "Sending JSON")
    This post covers posting JSON to an action method in ASP.NET MVC 2.
    Some of the code presented in this post is now built-in with ASP.NET
    MVC 3. (*39 comments, 37,668 web views, 21,899 aggregator views*)
-   [Razor View
    Syntax](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/07/03/razor-view-syntax.aspx "Razor View Syntax")
    This post gave a little bit of the backstory about the new Razor
    syntax our team built for ASP.NET MVC as well as a new product,
    ASP.NET Web Pages. (*43 comments, 27640 web views, 23234 aggregator
    views*)

My Top 3 Posts (Using the Haack Formula)
----------------------------------------

The Haack Formula just involves me arbitrarily picking my personal
favorites.

-   [We’re Not Paid To Write
    Code](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/08/26/not-paid-to-write-code.aspx "Not Paid To Write Code")
    I argue that there’s something else that we’re really being paid to
    do, and it’s not Solitaire.
-   [Not Really Interested in
    Lean](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/12/20/not-really-interested-in-lean.aspx "Not Really Interested in Lean")
    There’s something else I’m really interested in, lean is just a
    means to get there.
-   [Is Arrogance a Factor in
    Success](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/06/06/is-arrogance-a-factor-in-success.aspx "Arrogance")
    I argue that Joy is more important.

Enough About Me, What about You?
--------------------------------

Yes, I get self absorbed. But let’s set that aside a moment and talk
about you (insomuch as it pertains to me Me ME!). How you doin’?

According to Google Analytics:

-   **Hello Visitors!** 1,308,414 of you (absolute unique visitors) made
    1,972,239 visits to my blog came from 219 countries/territories.
    Most of you came from the United States (676,050) followed by the
    United Kingdom (170,814) with India (140,732) in third place.
-   **Browser of choice:**40.94% of you use Firefox, 29.2% use IE, and
    23.07% of you use Chrome. Probably not even worth mentioning, but
    3.43% of you use Safari and  2.32% of you use Opera. Opera?!
-   **Operating System:** Not surprisingly, 90.64% of you are on
    Windows. 5.11% on a Mac and 2.62% on Linux. The mobile devices are a
    tiny percentage, but I would imagine that’ll pick up a lot next
    year.
-   **What you read:** The blog post most visited in 2010 was written in
    2009, [Using jQuery Grid with ASP.NET
    MVC](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/04/14/using-jquery-grid-with-asp.net-mvc.aspx "Using jQuery Grid with MVC")
    with 93,715 page views.
-   **How’d you get here:** As usual, most of you came here via Google
    search results (1,120,983), which probably means most of you aren’t
    reading this. ![Winking
    smile](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)
    In second place, many of you came here directly (254,533) via typing
    the URL to this blog in an address bar (or clicking on a bookmark,
    etc.).
    [StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow") had a
    strong showing coming in third with 85,002 visits referred.

Podcasts/Videos
---------------

This next list is more for me than for you as I was curious about the
various interviews and talks I gave online. It’s the kind of list I
wouldn’t expect anyone but myself and my mother to be interested in. In
fact, I’m pretty sure my mother doesn’t care.

Suffice to say, there were plenty of opportunities for me to be aghast
at the sound of my own voice.

-   [.NET Rocks \#533 Phil Haack Introduces MVC
    2](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=533 ".NET Rocks")
    In this podcast, I talk about ASP.NET MVC 2 which we had just
    released.
-   [C4MVC – Phil Haack – ASP.NET MVC 2 – Web Development
    Safari](http://www.viddler.com/explore/c4mvc/videos/36/ "C4MVC Presentation")
    This is a recording of an online talk I gave to the virtual ASP.NET
    MVC user group, C4MVC (Community for MVC).
-   [.NET Rocks \#543 Phil Haack Live in Mountain
    View](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=543 ".NET Rocks Show 543")
    Carl and Richard took their show on the road and I was their first
    guest on the .NET Rocks roadshow. During the show I mistakenly gave
    out some interesting stats about Visual Studio. Those stats actually
    applied to the entire .NET Framework.
-   [Hanselminutes \#224 ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 with Phil
    Haack](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=242 "Hanselminutes Podcast")
    this is a podcast I recorded with Scott Hanselman.
-   [haack-mvc3](http://www.viddler.com/explore/mvcconf/videos/4/ "MvcConf")
    This is a talk recorded from a virtual online conference put on by
    the Community for MVC (C4MVC) called MvcConf. It was a free online
    conference that was well put together and well received by the
    audience.
-   [Web Camps TV \#1 – ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 and Razor Tips with Phil
    Haack](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Web+Camps+TV/Web-Camps-TV-1-ASPNET-MVC-3-Preview-1-and-Razor-Tips-with-Phil-Haack "Web Camps")
    This is a brief video where I demo ASP.NET MVC 3 and Razor. What’s
    notable to me in this video is that the shirt I’m wearing isn’t
    mine. I was wearing a white shirt with stripes and it was causing
    some moiré pattern effects so I had to borrow a t-shirt.
-   [Hanselminutes on 9 – ASP.NET MVC 3 and NEW ASP.NET Futures with
    Phil Haack and Morgan the
    Intern](http://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-ASPNET-MVC-3-and-NEW-ASPNET-Futures-with-Phil-Haack-and-Morgan-the-Intern "ASP.NET MVC 3")
    This is a nearly unwatchable video that goes back and forth between
    me and the intern, Morgan, with whom I shared my office. Even so,
    it’s a very candid video with some funny moments.
-   [Web Camps TV \#8 – NuPack with Phil
    Haack](http://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Web+Camps+TV/Web-Camps-TV-8-NuPack-with-Phil-Haack "Web Camps TV #8")
    this was recorded before we changed the name to NuGet.
-   [Hanselminutes 238 ASP.NET MVC 3 RC and NuGet Package Management
    with Phil
    Haack](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=257 "Hanselminutes Podcast")
    I’m back on the couch in this podcast recorded during the PDC
    conference with Scott Hanselman. What was interesting about this
    podcast was it was accidentally posted around a week before
    intended. So we talked about the release candidate of ASP.NET MVC in
    the past tense *before* it was released.
-   [.NET Rocks \#606 Phil Haack on Razor, MVC, NuPack, and
    More!](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=606 ".NET Rocks")
    Once again I chat with Carl and Richard about ASP.NET MVC, but this
    time we talk about ASP.NET MVC 3.

Well if you’ve read this far, wow! you must really be bored on your
holiday break. But seriously, if you’re a regular reader of my blog,
thanks for sticking around! I think 2011 is going to be an interesting
year as well and I’m looking forward to it.

Let me know if you have suggestions on how I can make my blog suck less.
