Every Friday the company buys lunch. Today we all received an email with
the list of choices from a Thai restaurant. I replied with "Orange
Chicken". Soon afterwards one of my coworkers thanks me for letting him
know I'm having Orange Chicken. Huh?

Then I get this email from another coworker:

> You know... for a second there I thought we would all be held in
> suspense while we tried to guess what you were going to have for
> lunch. \
> \
> I feel so much better knowing you plan on eating the orange chicken
> tomorrow; seriously it takes a lot off my mind...

Ahh, I've made the rookie AOLer mistake of hitting "Reply To All". I
swear this is my first time.

I responded that

> I'm a trend setter and it's my duty to inform the wannabes, losers,
> and biters of my choices so they have ample opportunity to jump on the
> bandwagon.

Besides, it's good to let the President of the company know that I'm an
up and comer. Orange Chicken is the choice for an individual who
deserves a very large raise. I work with a bunch of wise-asses.

UPDATE:It gets worse. After some good natured ribbing, I send out the
following to the "everyone" list.

> Hi All,\
> \
> I accidentally hit the “Reply To All” button earlier when indicating
> my choice for the savory options we have lined up for this Friday. I
> apologize for spamming you with my choice, which happened to be, and
> remains, Orange Chicken.\
> \
> I just wanted to make it clear that the company neither endorses nor

> position on your choice of Thai food other than to pick from the

> Therefore, if you should choose to go with Garlic and Pepper Beef, for

After hitting "SEND" I notice that there's a few emails in my inbox
where another coworker had been sending puzzles to the everyone list and
received a reprimand from our HR person, let's call her Bonnie.

> **This email address sends to everyone in {COMPANY} and should be used
> ONLY for business purposes. While I appreciate the heart of it is to
> share fun, addressing it to everyone is extremely inappropriate.**

So my "extremely inappropriate" email arrives in everyone's inbox AFTER
this one and my coworkers think I'm both hilarious and a dead man for my
"response" to Bonnie. I have some 'splaining to do.
