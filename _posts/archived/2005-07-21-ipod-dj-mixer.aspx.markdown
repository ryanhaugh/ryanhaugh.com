![IPod DJ Mixer](http://haacked.com/images/IPodMixer.jpg)When this whole
“Software Development” fad dies out (and yes, I am using air quotes here
with the two fingers), I know what my next calling will be: An IPod DJ!

Oh yeah, I’ll definitely be using this at the next house party I throw.
And yes, Kid AND Play are both invited.
