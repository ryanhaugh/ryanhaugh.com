![Mail](http://haacked.com/images/Mail.jpg)So you are coding along
riding that TDD high when you reach the point at which your code needs
to send an email. What do you do now?

You might consider writing something that looks like:

```csharp
EmailMessage email = new EmailMessage();
email.FromAddress = new EmailAddress(from);
email.AddToAddress(new EmailAddress(to));
email.Subject = subject;
email.BodyText = message;

SmtpServer smtpServer = new SmtpServer(SmtpServer, Port);
email.Send(smtpServer);
```

But you, being a TDD god(des) know better and quickly refactor that into
some sleek code that uses an `EmailProvider`. This ensures that your
code is not tied to any specific email implementation and will make unit
testing your code easier. Just swap out your concrete email provider for
a unit test specific email provider. Now your code looks like:

```csharp
EmailProvider.Instance().Send(to, from, subject, message);
```

But a nagging thought still pulls at the edge of your consciousness.
â€œShouldn’t I unit test my concrete email provider and actually make
sure the email gets sent correctly?

I certainly think so. As for the semantic arguments around whether this
really constitutes an *Integration Test* as opposed to a *Unit Test*,
please don’t bore me with your hang-ups. Either way, it deserves a test
and what better way to test it than using something like
[MbUnit](http://www.mertner.com/confluence/display/MbUnit/Home "MbUnit Generative Unit Testing Framework")
or [NUnit](http://nunit.com/ "NUnit Unit Testing Framework").

Wouldn’t it be nice to test your email code like so?

```csharp
DotNetOpenMailProvider provider = new DotNetOpenMailProvider();
NameValueCollection configValue = new NameValueCollection();
configValue["smtpServer"] = "127.0.0.1";
configValue["port"] = "8081";
provider.Initialize("providerTest", configValue);

TestSmtpServer receivingServer = new TestSmtpServer();
try
{
    receivingServer.Start("127.0.0.1", 8081);
    provider.Send("phil@example.com", 
                "nobody@example.com", 
                "Subject to nothing", 
                "Mr. Watson. Come here. I need you.");
}
finally
{
    receivingServer.Stop();
}

// So Did It Work?
Assert.AreEqual(1, receivingServer.Inbox.Count);
ReceivedEmailMessage received = receivingServer.Inbox[0];
Assert.AreEqual("phil@example.com", received.ToAddress.Email);
```

That there code starts up a mail server, sends an email to it, and then
checks that the mail server received the email. It also quickly checks
the to address.

This is a snippet of an actual unit test within the
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Blogging Engine")
codebase.

A long while ago I discovered a wonderful .NET based [freeware mail
server](http://www.lumisoft.ee/lsWWW/ENG/Products/Mail_Server/mail_index_eng.aspx?type=info "Mail Server")
written by Ivar Lumi. I decided to write a wrapper specifically for unit
testing scenarios. I added the `TestSmtpServer` to a new project named
`Subtext.UnitTesting.Servers` in the Subtext VS.NET solution.

The wrapper parses incoming SMTP messages and adds an
`ReceivedEmailMessage` instance to the `Inbox` custom collection. This
makes it easy to quickly examine the email messages sent via SMTP in
your unit test.

As this is a very early draft, there are some key limitations. I have
yet to implement multi-part messages and attachments in the object
model. I also punted on dealing with multiple *to* addresses. However,
the `ReceivedEmailMessage` class does have a `RawSmtpMessage` property
you can examine. For now, it works very well for simple text based
emails.

Over time, I hope to implement these more complicated testing features
as the need arises. However, if you find this useful and would like to
contribute, please do!

If you want to view the latest code, check out [these
instructions](http://subtextproject.com/Home/About/ViewTheCode/tabid/116/Default.aspx "View the Subtext Code")
for downloading the latest Subtext code using Subversion.

Or you can simply download this [one project
here](http://haacked.com/code/Subtext.TestMailServer.zip "Subtext.TestMailServer"),
though keep in mind that I will be updating this project, but not
necessarily this link to the project.

Since the project is specifically for unit testing purpsose, I went
ahead and embedded the unit tests for this server within the project
itself using MbUnit references. However you can simply swap out the
assemblies and references to use NUnit if that is your preference.
