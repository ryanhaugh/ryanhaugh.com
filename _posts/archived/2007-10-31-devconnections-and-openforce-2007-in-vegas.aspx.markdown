From Monday night to Thursday afternoon next week I will be in Las Vegas
attending both DevConnections/ASPConnections as well as the DotNetNuke
OpenForce conference. After that, I will be up in Redmond for the next
week.

I wrote before that I would be speaking on a couple panels at [OpenForce
conference](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/22/ill-be-speaking-about-open-source-at-openforce.aspx "Panels on OSS")
talking about open source and .NET.

If you're interested, the panels will be:

**Wednesday, Nov 7 - 8:00 AM - 9:15 AM Lagoon L**

DOS101: Panel Discussion: Open Source on the Microsoft \
Technology Stack\
*[Scott Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/ "ScottGu's Blog"), Phil
Haack, [Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Mr. Subsonic") and [Shaun
Walker](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/BlogID/1/Default.aspx "Shaun Walker")*

**Thursday, Nov 8 - 9:30 AM - 10:45 AM Lagoon F**

DOS102: Panel Discussion: .NET Open Source Architectural Models \
*[Joe
Brinkman](http://blog.theaccidentalgeek.com/ "The Accidental Geek"),
Phil Haack, [Jay Flowers](http://jayflowers.com/joomla/ "Jay Flowers"),
[Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") and Rob
Conery*

It's unfortunate that the first panel is at 8:00 AM because I never
really sleep much at all when I’m in Vegas. I pretty much have too much
fun (unless I’m losing bad). So if you run into me, I apologize in
advance for the fool I make of myself. ;)

Another talk you'll not want to miss is the MVC talk given by [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "ComputerZen") and [Eilon
Lipton](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/ "Eilon").

**Tuesday, Nov 6 - 2:30 PM - 3:30 PM Room 2**

AMS304: Introduction to the new ASP.NET Model View Controller (MVC)
Framework

*Scott Hanselman, Eilon Lipton*

I'll definitely be at this talk. These two are giving a couple of talks
together you can read about on [Scott’s
post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/DevConnectionsASPConnections2007InVegas.aspx "Scott Hanselman").
Come by and say hi.
