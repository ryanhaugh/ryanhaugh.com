Leave it to [Ian](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/) to cut through
the crap and give a [very clear and detailed
account](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/09/23/varisntobject)
of what exactly the new `var` keyword in C\# does.

When reading through blogs, mailing lists, and newsgroups, you can
encounter a lot of noise from people who are just looking for something
to rant about without actually taking the time to understand what
they’re talking about. This can be about the most annoying thing in the
world.

So if you caught yourself asking:

> What’s wrong with "Object"?

I encourage you to read [Ian’s
post](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2005/09/23/varisntobject).
