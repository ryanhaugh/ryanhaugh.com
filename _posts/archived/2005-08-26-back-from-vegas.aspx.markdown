Well I didn’t have a date with Destiny, but we had a productive meeting
with the client, and then he proceeded to ply us with drinks until we
were all having a very merry time at some bar (I think it’s called the
Jungle Room) in the Mandalay Bay).

It was such an obvious attempt to thwart our attempts to limit the scope
of the project to fit the budget (*Sure! We’ll build you an online
presence complete with mobile integration, CMS, CRM, and AJAX in
exchange for a Snickers bar, a bit of string and some pocket lint. Just
buy me another drink!*).

God I love Vegas.
