Today we finally officially released the beta of [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website") ([**go download it
already!**](http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=A24D1E00-CD35-4F66-BAA0-2362BDDE0766&displaylang=en "Download Link")).

True, the release has actually been available online since yesterday as
it was announced in a Keynote at VSLive by [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/), but that was intended to be a
special treat for attendees in what ended up being the [worst kept
secret](http://reddevnews.com/blogs/weblog.aspx?blog=2857 "ASP.NET MVC Goes Beta")
in .NET-dom.

As usual, to get all the details, check out the [latest epic installment
on
ScottGu’s](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/16/asp-net-mvc-beta-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Released")
blog. Scott Hanselman also has [a great blog
post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVCBetaReleasedCoolnessEnsues.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Beta released")
with good coverage as well.

[As I warned
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/05/mvcfutures-and-asp.net-mvc-beta.aspx "MvcFutures and ASP.NET MVC Beta"),
we no longer bundle the Mvc Futures assembly (`Microsoft.Web.Mvc.dll`).
However, we did just [publish a release of this assembly updated for
Beta on
CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=18459 "ASP.NET MVC Beta Futures").
Source code for the Beta and Futures releases will be pushed to CodePlex
shortly. Sorry about the delay but there’s so much work to be done here.
:)

One very exciting element to this release is that we’ve included JQuery
([as I mentioned
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/30/jquery-and-asp.net-mvc.aspx "JQuery and ASP.NET MVC"))
and are indeed the first Microsoft product to include it. One of the
first Microsoft products (AFAIK) to bundle a third-party open source
component.

The following list (each a link to the GU’s blog) show's what’s new in
the Beta.

    Deployment](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/10/16/asp-net-mvc-beta-released.aspx#eleven)

I hope you enjoy this release and the plan from here on out is primarily
to focus on stabilization. This means fixing bugs, making design change
requests which we feel hit meet a high bar, and getting the product
ready for RTM. However, as Scott mentioned, there are a few new features
we’re planning, especially with Visual Studio tooling.
