UPDATE: I linked to the wrong post. I corrected the link.

During the recent Insiders summit,
[Wally](http://weblogs.asp.net/wallym/ "Wally McClure") cornered me into
recording a really short video demonstrating a feature of ASP.NET MVC. I
decided to sprinkle a little Ajax in my demo by showing how to use
[jQuery](http://jquery.com/ "jQuery is a new type of JavaScript library")
to call an action that returns a `JsonResult`.

Specifically, I show how to update a couple of regions in the page (two
dom elements) with data pulled from the server. I then add a little
sparkle to the demo by implementing the ubiquitous yellow fade when
adding the content to the DOM. As you’re watching it, you’ll notice that
I’m making it up on the fly based on another demo I did earlier that
day.

in show \#~~106~~ 121. That’s heckuva a lot of shows Wally!
