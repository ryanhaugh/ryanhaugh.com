UPDATE: [Via

I learned that the video was leaked to YouTube prior to its world
premier and has been taken down. You can find the song on [Weird Al’s
MySpace page](http://www.myspace.com/weirdal). I’ve updated my link.

[![White and
Nerdy](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ThinkImJustTooWhiteAndNerdy_BC52/TooWhiteAndNerdy4.png)](http://www.myspace.com/weirdal)

This video from Weird Al Yankovich cracks me up with such lyrical gems
like this:

> The only question\
> I ever thought was hard.\
> Is do I like Kirk?\
> Or do I like Picard?\

Mad props to Al whose flow could give Eminem a run for his money.  Click
on the image to watch the video on YouTube. Beware, the tune is catchy
and you might catch yourself singing it later.
