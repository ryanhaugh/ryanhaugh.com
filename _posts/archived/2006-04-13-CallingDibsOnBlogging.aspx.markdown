![Dibs](http://haacked.com/images/dibs.jpg)I love working with other
developers who are really excited about technology and the work we are
doing. As is characteristic of such an organization, there is a constant
flurry of IM messages and emails with links to interesting new
technologies and topics.

This is nothing new of course, except for a recent phenomena of calling
dibs to blog these topics. Is this something that happens to you? Let me
give you an example.

A little while back, [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway's Blog") IMs
me a link to [this very cool
tool](http://www.codeproject.com/dotnet/RemoveSCCInfo.asp "Remove Source Control Bindings")
to remove source control bindings from a VS.NET 2003 project.

Immediately I start firing up
[w.Bloggar](http://wbloggar.com/ "Blog Posting Tool") when his next IM
message comes through, *Oh, by the way I am going to blog that*. He
called dibs on blogging it.

This doesn’t mean that he *owns* this information somehow. Certainly
there are others who have blogged about it. But I do feel it is good
form to defer, since we probably have a similar readership. To that end,
I present the **rules for calling blogging dibs**, which have their
roots in concurrent software development.

-   **Dib Contention:** In conversation, if the person (the originator)
    who mentions the interesting link or story (the content) does not
    call dibs, and another person does, dib rights are lost to the
    originator.
-   **Dib Wait Condition** The listener must give the originator a
    reasonable moment (a pause really) to call dibs. Afterwards all bets
    are off.
-   **Dib Hijacking** In IM conversation, the originator has exactly one
    message (or 30 seconds) after the content to call dibs. If the next
    IM message is off topic, the other party may call dibs at any time..
-   **Dib Deadlock Resolution** Tie goes to the originator.
-   **Implicit Dib Call** In the absense of a dib call, it is assumed
    the originator has dibs until some point it is taken away by an
    explicit dib call.
-   **Dib Race Condition** If the listener can write and post the entire
    blog post before the originator calls dibs, the originator loses
    dibs privileges for obvious reasons.
-   **Dib Access Violation** Violating another person’s dibs right loses
    the offending party’s dibs rights for a period no less than two
    weeks.
-   **Dib Timeout Condition** A dib has a shelf life of one week. If no
    blog post is forthcoming, dib rights are fair game.
-   **Dib Finalization** Once the originator has written a post. The
    listener may follow up. It is good form to link to the originator’s
    post.
-   Keep dibs in the freezer, or they melt.

So go out there and steal someone else’s thunder. But do it according to
the rules.

I violated one of my own rules. Can you figure out which one?
