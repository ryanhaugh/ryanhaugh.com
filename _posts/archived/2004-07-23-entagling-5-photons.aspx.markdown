Scientists will soon rip open the door to real Quantum computing. Will
it be a peek into alternate universes? Or will it fizzle with a whimper?

> Physicists have succeeded in entangling five photons for the first
> time. Although four photons have been entangled before, five is the
> minimum number needed for universal error correction in quantum
> computation. Moreover, the same team has demonstrated a process called
> "open-destination teleportation" for the first time (Z Zhao et al.
> 2004 Nature 430 54). The results represent a major breakthrough in
> efforts to exploit the laws of quantum mechanics in quantum
> information processing.
