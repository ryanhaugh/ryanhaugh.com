Finally I've gotten around to contributing an article to the [Code
Project](http://www.codeproject.com/) community. Writing articles and
whatnot has always been on my //TODO: list, but until now, I've only had
articles published on my blog (not counting the [RSS Bandit user
documentation](http://www.rssbandit.org/docs))

Surprise of surprises, the article I submitted is about a [configuration
section
handler](http://www.codeproject.com/csharp/CsConfigSechandler.asp).
Basically the same thing I posted here. Code Project is fine with that
as long as I'm the copyright holder of the article.

Ok, so that's two technical posts in a row, time to write something
non-geek... Think! Think!
