[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") has a
pretty sweet [Continuous Integration
setup](http://haacked.dyndns.org/ccnet/ViewFarmReport.aspx "CCNET Dashboard")
using
[CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET "CCNET Site") running
inside a virtual server inside a real computer in my home office. The
man responsible for this setup is [Simone
Chiaretta](http://codeclimber.net.nz/ "Simone Chiarreta's Blog"), who
just unveiled his new English language blog,
[CodeClimber](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2006/12/11/Here-I-am.-writing-in-English.aspx "CodeClimber Blog").

His former blog was in Italian, which made it diffult reading for me, as
[Babelfish](http://babelfish.altavista.com/ "Babelfish Translator")
totally mangled translations.  When Simone is not writing about broken
ribs from kite surfing or bagging the latest peak, he just might get
around to writing about the CCNET setup he created for Subtext.
