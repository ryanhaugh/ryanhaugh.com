on the necessity of marketing and advertising in general in response to
Microsoft’s recent viral marketing efforts.

Blah Blah Blah

What grabbed *my* attention was the new word he coined (or if he didn’t
coin it, he brought it to my attention and that is good enough).

**Whorosity**

I just have to add it to my vocabulary. I’ve tried to coin terms in the
past [such as
blogtegrity](/archive/2006/03/07/BlogtegrityAgain.aspx "Blogtegrity")
that I hoped would catch on, but I realize now that I’m just stooping to
linguistic whorosity.
