![ASP.NET 2.0
Anthology](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/BuyOurBookAndBecomeAnASP.NETBadAss_12E22/41XDcuGaQrL._AA240_.jpg)I
just received a few advanced copies of our new book and am giving away
three of them to the **first three people** who leave a comment on this
post.

**But there’s a catch!**

You have to have a blog and promise to write a review on your blog. This
is on the honor system so I’ll send you the book and you can then review
it.

In your comment, leave your email address in the email field (it’s not
visible to anyone else) and I’ll follow up to get your mailing address.
Also let me know if you want it signed or not. Not sure why you’d want
that, but you never know.
