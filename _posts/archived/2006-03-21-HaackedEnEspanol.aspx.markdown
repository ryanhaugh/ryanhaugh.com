[Luciano Spiguel](http://huapi.blogspot.com/ "Blog of Luciano Spiguel")
just posted a partial translation of my post entitled [Does Mort Know
We’re Talking Smack About Him Behind His
Back](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/03/9210.aspx "Discussing Mort")
in Spanish. I’m actually quite honored that someone saw that as being
worth a translation.
