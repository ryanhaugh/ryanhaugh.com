In the past, I’ve [tried various schemes to structure my unit
tests](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/10/Structuring_Unit_Test_Code.aspx "Structuring Unit Test Code")
but never fell into a consistent approach. Pretty much the only rule I
had (which I broke all the time) was to write a test class for each
class I tested. I would then fill that class with a ton of haphazard
test methods.

That was until I saw the approach that [Drew
Miller](http://half-ogre.com/ "Drew Miller's Twitter") took with
NuGet.org. The way he structured the unit tests struck me as odd at
first, but quickly won me over. Drew tells me he can’t take all the
credit for this approach. This approach came from when he worked at
CodePlex, and builds upon practices he learned from [Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson's Blog") and [Jim
Newkirk](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/ "James Newkirk's Blog").
That’s the thing I like about Drew, he won’t take credit for other
people’s work. Unlike me, of course.

The structure has a test class per class being tested. That’s not so
unusual. But what was unusual to me was that he had a nested class for
each method being tested.

I’ll provide a simple code example to illustrate this approach and then
highlight some of the benefits. The following has two methods for
embellishing names with more interesting titles. What it does isn’t
really that important for this discussion.

```csharp
using System;

public class Titleizer
{
    public string Titleize(string name)
    {
        if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
            return "Your name is now Phil the Foolish";
        return name + " the awesome hearted";
    }

    public string Knightify(string name, bool male)
    {
        if (String.IsNullOrEmpty(name))
            return "Your name is now Sir Jester";
        return (male ? "Sir" : "Dame") + " " + name;
    }
}
```

Under Drew’s system, I’ll have a corresponding top level class, with two
embedded classes, one for each method. In each class, I’ll have a series
of tests for that method.

Let’s look at a set of potential tests for this class. I wrote
[xUnit.NET](http://xunit.codeplex.com/ "xUnit.NET") tests for this, but
you could apply the same approach with NUnit, mbUnit, or whatever you
use.

```csharp
using Xunit;

public class TitleizerFacts
{
    public class TheTitleizerMethod
    {
        [Fact]
        public void ReturnsDefaultTitleForNullName()
        {
            // Test code
        }

        [Fact]
        public void AppendsTitleToName()
        {
            // Test code
        }
    }

    public class TheKnightifyMethod
    {
        [Fact]
        public void ReturnsDefaultTitleForNullName()
        {
            // Test code
        }

        [Fact]
        public void AppendsSirToMaleNames()
        {
            // Test code
        }

        [Fact]
        public void AppendsDameToFemaleNames()
        {
            // Test code
        }
    }
}
```

Pretty simple, right? If you want to see a real-world example, look at
these [tests of the user service within
NuGet.org](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/blob/master/Facts/Services/UsersServiceFacts.cs "User Service Facts").

So why do this at all? Why not stick with the old way I’ve done in the
past?

Well for one thing, it’s a nice way to keep tests organized. All the
tests (or facts) for a method are grouped together. For example, if you
use the `CTRL+M`, `CTRL+O` shortcut to collapse method bodies, you can
easily scan your tests and read them like a spec for your code.

[![unittests-spec](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-spec_thumb.png "unittests-spec")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-spec_2.png)

You also get the same effect if you run your tests in a test runner such
as the xUnit test runner:

[![unittests-testrunner](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-testrunner_thumb_1.png "unittests-testrunner")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-testrunner_4.png)

When the test class file is open in Visual Studio, the class drop down
provides a quick way to see a list of the methods you have tests for.

![unittests-method-list](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-method-list_3.png "unittests-method-list")

This makes it easy to then see all the tests for a given method by using
the drop down on the right.

![unittests-test-list](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Structuring-Unit-Tests_CF0E/unittests-test-list_3.png "unittests-test-list")

It’s a minor change to my existing practices, but one that I’ve grown to
like a lot and hope to apply in all my projects in the future.

**Update**: Several folks asked about how to have common setup code for
all tests. [ZenDeveloper has a simple
solution](http://zendeveloper.blogspot.com/2012/01/structuring-unit-tests.html "ZenDeveloper's structuring tests")
in which the nested child classes simply inherit the outer parent class.
Thus they’ll all share the same setup code.
