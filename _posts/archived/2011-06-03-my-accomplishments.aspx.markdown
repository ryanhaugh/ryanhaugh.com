It’s that time of year at Microsoft when managers are busily preparing
reviews of their reports and preparing for the big [stack
ranking](http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/06/microsofts-30-or-how-i-learned-to-stop.html "Stack Ranking").

Yesterday, my manager sent out an email asking his reports to email him
with their accomplishments in the past year to help jog his memory. This
arms him with important information when he goes to the mat for us
arguing why we’re more deserving of a higher ranking than some other
manager’s sad report.

Here was my response. In the past year, I…

-   Escaped from a black hole. Twice. I forgot my jacket in there and
    had to go get it.
-   Discovered an albino polar bear.
-   Proved Fermat’s Last Theorem as well as his penultimate theorem.
-   Found Waldo. And made him change out of that ridiculous shirt and
    hat. Discovered he’s really Harry Potter.
-   Unified gravity and quantum mechanics while watching Jersey Shore to
    make it a challenge.
-   Invented cold fusion as well as luke warm fusion.
-   Passed the turing test using a computer made of legos.
-   Finished World of Warcraft on an Atari 2600.
-   Counted all the elements within an uncountable set of Hilbert
    spaces.
-   Hunted a magical unicorn with my bare hands. Drank its blood. And
    now I’m magical.

Color me impressed!

Friday Appreciation
-------------------

And for the weekly thing I appreciate, this week I appreciate the word
**hyperbole**. It sounds like hyperbola, but is a totally different
thing. Be sure not to confuse the two.

What I did above is hyperbole, while this is a hyperbola.

Have a nice weekend!
