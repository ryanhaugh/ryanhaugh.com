![Hattori Hanzo](/images/hattoriHanzo.jpg) A while ago I wrote about
[Seppuku, Katanas, and
Samurai](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/04/1813.aspx) and made a
joking reference to Hattori Hanzo.

In my comments someone named Lazken notes that a Hattori Hanzo did
exist, but he did not make swords. You can read about [Hanzo in the
samurai archives](http://www.samurai-archives.com/hanzo.html).

Lazken goes on to say that we watch too many Kill Bill movies. Umm...
dude... there's only two of them. ;)
