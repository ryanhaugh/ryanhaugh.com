This morning I woke up with visions of sugar code dancing in my head. It
is a coding day and I was ready to sling it, only to be bowled over in
stomach pain. Not sure what it was, but it was very unpleasant and
wasn’t accompanied by any other symptoms like gas or otherwise.

So I put a heat pack on my stomach and went right back to sleep and just
got up and am feeling somewhat better. At least I wasn’t in poor
[Danah’s
shoes](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/archives/2005/12/08/dear_principal.html).
No worshipping of the porcelain god this time.
