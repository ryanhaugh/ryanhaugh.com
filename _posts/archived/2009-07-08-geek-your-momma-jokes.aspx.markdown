Ok, I haven’t had a good track record with making up jokes before. Just
see exhibit A,[this groaner of an MVC
joke](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/01/29/so-a-model-a-view-and-a-controller-walk-into.aspx).

However, I think I did oke recently with a few geeky Your Momma jokes
that I can’t just leave to Twitter alone. Here they are:

> Your momma so fat, Bloatware is her clothing line.
>
> Your momma so fat I called her and got a stack overflow.
>
> your momma so ugly its just best to forego the "V" in MVC with her.

So now it’s your turn. Please post your best ones in the comments to
this post. :)
