![Lightning Storm](http://haacked.com/images/LightningStorm.jpg)We just
had a short lived but crazy loud lightning storm. I was up late working
on Subtext because I couldn’t sleep when I started hearing the loud clap
of thunder. The eerie part is that between the thunder claps, it was
relatively silent outside until the next thunder clap.

I counted less than a second between some of the lightning flashes and
the resultant thunder, meaning the bolts were pretty damn close. The
immense loudness was awesome and set off all the car alarms in the
neighborhood as well as a building alarm. Perhaps the school or church
nearby. I was busy trying to shut down my computer.

As the lightning and thunder subsided, the rain started to come down
really hard for about 15 minutes. Then nothing. Strangely enough, my dog
didn’t make a sound. I wonder if she slept through the whole thing.
