My latest task is to produce reports useful for fraud detection. We’ve
recently had incidents in which users from Vietnam opened up several
accounts via stolen credit cards, deposited money via Paypal, then
commit a charge back.

I won’t go into details about the specifics of these reports, but they
simply identify common patterns in fraudulent activity and alert us to
the potential mischief.
