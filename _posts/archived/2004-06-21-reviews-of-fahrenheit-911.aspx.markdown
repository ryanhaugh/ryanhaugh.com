![Michael Moore](/images/MichaelMoore.jpg)I found this [scathing
review](http://slate.msn.com/id/2102723/fr/rss/) on
[Slate](http://www.slate.com/) of Michael Moore and his upcoming flick,
*Fahrenheit 9/11* I have yet to see the movie but plan to soon. It's
good to read a critical review to make sure I have a balanced view of
the movie.

I don't doubt that Michael Moore is biased and self-serving. His movie
is designed to provoke a strong reaction, and whether the facts are
misinterpreted or self-contradicting, that's not important to his goals.
I figure I will have to take his message with a grain of salt. Many will
see his movie once, while they watch Fox news every day. The truth
probably lies somewhere in the middle.

As a counterpoint to the scathing review, I offer up [another
review](http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-0406200376jun20,0,5152811.story?coll=mmx-movies_heds)
that points out the great lengths the Moore team went to fact check all
their assertions. The review does point out that Moore does insert his
prejudices in places, but that his central assertion is well-founded.

> the royal family and of the large and fabulously wealthy bin Laden
> clan, which has insisted it long ago disowned Osama.
