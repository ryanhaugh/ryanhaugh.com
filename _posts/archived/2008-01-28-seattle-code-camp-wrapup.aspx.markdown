The [Seattle Code Camp](https://seattle.codecamp.us/default.aspx) (which
despite the misleading photo, isn’t a camping trip) is now over and I
have nothing but good things to say about it. I didn’t get a chance to
see a lot of talks but did enjoy the xUnit.net talk by [Jim
Newkirk](http://jamesnewkirk.typepad.com/) and [Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/). I’m a fan of their approach to
providing extensibility and this session provided all the impetus I
needed to really give xUnit.net a try rather than simply talking about
trying it. :)

As for my own talk, I had the great pleasure of showing up late to my
talk. To this moment, I still don’t know why my alarm didn’t go off. All
indications are that it was set properly.

My wife woke me up at 9:00 AM asking, “Don’t you have a talk to give
today?” I sure did, at 9:15 AM. I drove like a madman from Mercer Island
(sorry to all the people I cut off) to Redmond and ended up being around
10 minutes late I think.

Fortunately the attendees were patiently waiting and despite my frazzled
approach, I think the presentation went fairly well. Perhaps [Chris
Tavares](http://www.tavaresstudios.com/Blog/default.aspx) can tell me in
private how it *really* went. ;) Thanks to everyone who attended and
refrained from heckling me. I appreciate the restraint and
thoughtfulness.

By the way, Chris is part of the P&P group, but he’s also a member of
the ASP.NET MVC feature team. I think his role is a *P&P liason* or
something like that. Mainly he’s there to give great advice and help us
out. So definitely give his blog a look for some great software wisdom.

As this was my first Code Camp, I am definitely looking forward to the
next one.
