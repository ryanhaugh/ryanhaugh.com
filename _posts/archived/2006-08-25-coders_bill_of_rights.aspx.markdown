sticking my head above water long enough to take a breath and to link to
some rubbish called the [Programmer’s Bill of
Rights](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000666.html "Programmer's Bill of Rights")
that [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) declares on his
blog.

I don't understand this guy.  You let this sort of dangerous propaganda
spread and software departments will become much more efficient and be
able to build better systems with less money. 

You realize what that means, don't you?  Companies will be able **to get
more done with less people**. 

For those who lose their jobs because of this, blame Atwood.  Then
again, if you’re reading his blog, you're probably not the target
audience that would get laid off due to increased efficiency.  Readers
of my blog on the other hand ...
