Security expert Bruce Schneier [writes a fantastic
essay](http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2006/05/the_value_of_pr.html "The Value of Privacy")
on the value of privacy. This is a great response to the rhetorical
question “If you aren’t doing anything wrong, what do you have to hide?”
often used to counter privacy advocates.

A couple key points he makes.

> Privacy protects us from abuses by those in power, even if we're doing
> nothing wrong at the time of surveillance.
>
> ...
>
> Too many wrongly characterize the debate as "security versus privacy."
> The real choice is liberty versus control. Tyranny, whether it arises
> under threat of foreign physical attack or under constant domestic
> authoritative scrutiny, is still tyranny. Liberty requires security
> without intrusion, security plus privacy. Widespread police
> surveillance is the very definition of a police state. And that's why
> we should champion privacy even when we have nothing to hide.

It reminds me of this political cartoon in the paper today.
