I think it's about time to found a group devoted to helping blogging
addicts deal with a new and pervasive addiction. This occurred to me the
other day when my wife needed help putting away the dishes and I mumbled
something about "Only 86 more entries to go in
[Scoble's](http://www.kunal.org/scoble/) link blog."

Let's just say that she was not amused.

So to help others out there who may suffer from the same affliction, I
offer some scientific indicators that you too might be a blogging
addict.

-   You're name is [Robert Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/)
-   You subscribe to Scoble's link blog
-   You're reading this post and it's still Thanksgiving.
-   You're blogging about your addiction...on Thanksgiving
-   You try to regale your friends with interesting stories, but they've
    already read it on your blog.
-   These same friends only email you with interesting links hoping to
    make your blog.
-   In order to get you to take out the garbage, your wife posts a
    comment on your blog.

Take heed of these indicators and if you identify yourself to be a
blogaholic, join in my new Blogaholics Anonymous group. We'll be meeting
in the comments section of this post. Oh, and go help your wife with the
dishes.
