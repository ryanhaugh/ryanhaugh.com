UPDATE: Sorry, but this site appears to be down now. I'll try to find
the tools and upload them elsewhere.

My colleague [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon -the gallows- Galloway")
has been on a spree of unleashing useful
[tools](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/07/26/IE7-Standalone-_2800_Updated-for-IE7-Beta-3_2900_.aspx "IE7 Standalone")
lately. I released a few of my own as
[well](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/07/27/IntroducingCaptainHookASubversionHookFrameworkFor.NET.aspx "Subversion Hooks").

One thing in common with these little tools and utilities is that we are
hosting them on our new company tools site,
[http://tools.veloc-it.com/](http://tools.veloc-it.com/ "Tools").

These tools are little scripts and apps that we use internally to
increase our efficiency. Many of them relieve us from the drudgery of
boring repetitive tasks. Quite likely, these are the tools that many of
you would write yourself if you only had the time (some of them you
probably already have written. I swear we did not plagiarize you). We
hope you find them useful. There aren’t that many now, but over time we
will add to the catalog.

You might be wondering, if these tools make us more efficient,
potentially giving us a competitive advantage, why are we giving them
away? Good question. I hadn’t thought of that. Jon! Take down the site!

Well the truth of the matter is that it is a way for us to show off how
amazingly smart we are so we can get more clients, fame, and adulation.

Uhhh... Ok. Maybe not.

Let’s be realistic. Decision makers and CEOs are not dinking around the
web looking for an [Abstract Boilerplate
HttpHandler](http://tools.veloc-it.com/Default.aspx "Abstract Boilerplate HttpHandler").

Not only that, most of what we post here is not supremely innovative
rocket science and going to make someone rich. If we had such a tool,
you think I’d be blogging about software tools? No way man! I’d be
regaling you with stories about the funny looking crab that walked up to
the porch of my immense beach house in Hawaii. But I digress.

Part of the reason is certainly to increase exposure of our company, as
I know we do some kick-butt work. Over time, we hope that our site will
reflect the quality of the work we do for our clients. But our primary
reason is the same reason we’ve been posting such tools even before
there was a [VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT"). We enjoy helping
other developers benefit from what we’ve learned. Likewise, we
appreciate the tools and learning shared by other developers that have
benefitted us. **In the end, I think this sharing elevates the entire
profession.**
