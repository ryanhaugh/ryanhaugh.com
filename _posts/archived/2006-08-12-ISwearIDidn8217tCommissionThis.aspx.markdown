Or did I?

[JackAce](http://codeturkey.blogspot.com/ "Coding Turkey Blog"), a
former coworker of mine and total poker addict, happened upon this fine
piece of artwork and astutely snapped this picture for posterity with
his T-Mobile (click through to go to the original flickr pic).

Soon the entire city of Angels will know the name of **Haack**!!!
BWAHAHA!

Unfortunately the idiot taggers didn’t follow my instructions. I told
them to tag my **URL**, not my name.

**Eeeeediots!**

Good taggers are hard to find. You might promote **your** blog by
writing good content, posting comments in other blogs, and other such
nonsense, and hey that’s cool for you. But this is how we roll in L.A.

**Westside!**
