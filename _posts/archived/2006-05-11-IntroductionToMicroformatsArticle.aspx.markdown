Lest you think I sit around spending all my time on [computer
games](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/11/AdmittingYourAddictionIsTheFirstStep.aspx "addiction")
and soccer, I also try to write occasionally.

Today an article I have been working for a while has finally been
published on DevSource. It is entitled a *[A Developerâ€™s Introduction to
Microformats](http://www.devsource.com/article2/0,1895,1961106,00.asp "Article on Microformats")*
and attempts to present a clear introductory look at Microformats. This
is my second article for DevSource, [the
first](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/17/DevSourceArticleOnExceptions.aspx "Article on Exceptions")
being one I helped that crazy [Bob
Reselman](http://codingslave.blogspot.com/ "Coding Slave") write.

I was fired up to write this article after [attending the
Mix06](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/21/Mix06MicroformatsAutodiscovery.aspx "Mix06 highlights")
conference. Hearing Bill Gates mention Microformats (whether O'Reilly
fed it to him or not) highlights the fact that Microformats are poised
to really take off. There are some detractors and potential real
problems with syndicating Microformats, so it will be interesting to see
how they are solved.

In any case, check it out and let me know what you think. Did I present
it well?

And before I forget, big ups to the Microformats mailing list for
helping me think through some of these topics I covered.
