Ok, I admit it. I’m a unit-tester-aholic. I’m compulsive about it.
Sometimes going overboard:

```csharp
string s = "hello world";Assert.AreEqual(s, "hello world", "s changed. How about that?");
```

[MbUnit](http://mbunit.com/ "MbUnit Unit Testing Framework") is my
friend. I feel a great sense of accomplishment when I can write a fully
automated end to end unit test of an email Newsletter mailer.
Previously, testing such an app required me to run the code, open up
Outlook, check my email, and “uh huh, looks good.&8221; Now, by using a
custom SMTP server class running on a separate thread (and on a custom
port), my unit test can send a batch of emails and then ask the server
if everything looks as its supposed to. “Aye aye. Everything checks out
capt’n.”

However, there are certain cases that threaten to cure my obsessive
compulsive behavior. For example, unit testing the pathological cases.
Now ideally, these cases should happen infrequently enough that perhaps
you can let them go. Sweep them under the carpet. Nobody has to know.
Besides, who runs out of memory these days?

\*raising hand\* Well I did today. And I didn’t have a unit test for it.
I could probably be forgiven for this one. I’m writing a Windows service
that reads data into 10 DataSets. As each DataSet is read, I
asynchronously open an SMTP connection and begin performing a mail-merge
on that data set. I made sure to cap the number of concurrent
connections to 10.

Now this app passed all my unit tests, but when I deployed it to the
production server, it ran out of memory. After some analysis with a
memory profiler, I discovered that I had violated [Performance Rule
\#6,](http://www.panopticoncentral.net/PermaLink.aspx/eacfc5e0-42df-44b0-bb9a-94354b689b17#1d6d1f3c-3fd6-4e09-8761-de3dc769a27a "Performance Rule")
“90% of performance problems are designed in, not coded in.”

Each chunk of data I read in from the database is wrapped in a
RecipientBundle class. The service then gives this class to an SmtpPool
class which then schedules it to be sent on an available thread. The
SmtpPool class keeps an ArrayList of the scheduled bundles to avoid
sending duplicate bundles.

Hopefully you see the problem with this approach. I had a complete brain
shutdown when I wrote the code to add the bundle to the ArrayList. Since
the ArrayList is only used to avoid duplicate bundles, all that is
necessary is to store the ID of the bundle. By adding the bundle, the
ArrayList is holding a referenc to the bundle, thus making sure it never
gets garbage collected until the entire mailing is complete. Bad move.
These bundles should be generation 0 objects. Created, sent, garbage
collected.

So in any case, I’m thinking about whether or not I should write a unit
case for dealing with OutOfMemoryExceptions. There are a lot of
difficulties in doing so. Typically, for a case like this, I will try to
write a unit test that fakes it. I will talk about how I do that later.

I already have a unit test for dealing with the ThreadAbortException.
That’s also a story for another time as there are several difficulties
with deaing with the ThreadAbortException. For example, it doesn’t seem
to get raised in my methods that are running asynchronously. They just
seem to die without a whimper. Also, there’s a [slight
issue](http://headblender.com/joe/blog/archives/geekness/001084.html "Slight Issue with the Finally Block")
with the CLR such that the finally block isn’t guaranteed to execute.

Till next time
