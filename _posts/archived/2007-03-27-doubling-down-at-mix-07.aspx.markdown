You’ve been
H![AAA](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/DoublingDownAtMix07_10E98/fun_cards%5B5%5D.jpg)
CKED will be well represented at [Mix
07](http://visitmix.com/ "Mix 07 website") this year. I thoroughly
enjoyed Mix 06 last year and think 07 has the potential to be even
better.

**Do not worry, I’m leaving the retina scorching**[**orange aloha
shirt**](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/15/SeeYouAtMix06.aspx "See You At Mix 06")**at
home this time.**

My only disappointment with Mix 07 so far is it doesn’t have quite the
clever rhyme that Mix 06 did. My wife did a cheer for me as I left for
last year’s the conference.

> Mix! Oh-Six! Mix! Oh-Six! Mix! Oh Six!

“Mix! Oh-Seven!” doesn’t roll off the tonque quite in the same manner.
No cheers from my wife this year.

**There are many people I’m looking forward to hanging out with in
attendance this year. **I like to think that it was me who convinced
[Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") to
attend this year’s Mix conference. [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway"), [Jeff
Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror blog"), and [Rob
Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery’s Blog") will all be
there. It may take that many to drag me away from the craps table before
I lose my future son’s college tuition.

I also think [Steve (Lucky 21)
Maine](http://hyperthink.net/blog/ "Steve Maine") will be there (is that
right Steve?). Last year he watched as the Craps dealers rolled their
eyes when I only bought \$40 worth of chips (it’s all I had) at a \$10
table. I then proceeded to turn that into around \$300, only to lose the
bulk of that at BlackJack later. No more BlackJack after Craps!

I think [Adam (Is it 9 or 10?)
Kinney](http://adamkinney.com/ "Adam Kinney") will also be in
attendance. If *you* are planning to be there, let me know in the
comments!

**If you’re a
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") user**,
feel free to swing by and tell me how much Subtext is a [*godawful mess
run by a retarded monkey and is possibly responsible for your pet’s
death*|*wonderful piece of sublime software that enriches your life in a
way you never thought a .NET blog engine could*] (or any option in
between).

If you’re not a Subtext user, tell me how much you’ve *heard* that
Subtext is a [*godawful mess run by a retarded monkey and is possibly
responsible for your pet’s death*|*wonderful piece of sublime software
that enriches your life in a way you never thought a .NET blog engine
could*]

And if I have time left over, I may just attend a few sessions.
Seriously though, I really enjoyed many of the sessions last year. Funny
how much you can still learn while hung-over and sleep deprived. I kid.
I kid.
