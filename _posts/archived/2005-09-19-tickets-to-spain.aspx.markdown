Picked up our airline tickets to Spain today. Weâ€™ll be visiting in
November, landing in Madrid, travelling through Andalucia and ending up
in Barcelona. The main thing I want to visit in Madrid is the area where
I used to live called Torrejon de Ardoz.

On the way there, we have a five hour stop over in Philadelphia. Apart
from eating some cheesesteaks, anybody know what there is to do in
Philly?
