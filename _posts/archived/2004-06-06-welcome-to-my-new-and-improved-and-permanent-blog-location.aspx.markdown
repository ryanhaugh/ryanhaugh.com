I finally decided to quit being a cheap-ass and so I purchased web
hosting with [WebHost4Life](http://www.webhost4life.com/). Now my blog
is hosted at http://haacked.com/ rather than that old ugly domain name
(http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/).

If you subscribe to my RSS feed, please change the URL to
[http://haacked.com/Rss.aspx](http://haacked.com/Rss.aspx)

Oh, and by the way, if you sign up for WebHost4Life, be sure to tell
them I sent ya [via this
link](http://www.webhost4life.com/default.asp?refid=haacked).
