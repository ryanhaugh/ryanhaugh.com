I've been playing with DotNetNuke at home and after an hour or two,
VS.NET 2003 is typically using up around 150 to 200 MB of RAM as well as
200 MB of virtual memory. Web development on VS.NET is a big memory hog
when the project size gets large enough.

Since I'm running on a paltry 512 MB of RAM (since when did 512 MB of
RAM become paltry? I spent \$99 to upgrade my Amiga from 512 KB of RAM
to 1MB, but I digress) I thought it's about time to upgrade my system.

Looking at prices today, I found a nice deal on a 2GB Kingston kit
(2x1GB) for \$278.98. Not a bad price, eh? I'm wondering if 2GB is just
plain overkill. Then again, if I run some virtual pc instances, I might
want that extra memory.

Compare this to a Kingston 1GB kit (2x512MB) for \$94.48. 1GB is a lot
cheaper. I should mention that I have a 800 MHZ FSB so I'm looking at
PC3200 DDR 400 memory cards.

Oh, and this post is my new personal record for number of acronyms in a
post.
