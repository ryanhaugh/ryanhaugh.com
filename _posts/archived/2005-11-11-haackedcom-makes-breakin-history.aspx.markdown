I would like to take this moment to point out that as far as I know (and
the judges are still confirming this), I may have made history with [my
last blog post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/12/11184.aspx) as the
first geek blogger in history to mention
[Breakin'](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086998/), [Electric
Boogaloo](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086999/) and [Beat
Streat](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086946/) all in the same blog post with
proper [IMDB](http://imdb.com/) linkage.

For you young whippersnappers who missed out on this fine piece of
cinema history, you are in luck. Amazon.com offers up its *[Breakinâ€™
Collection](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009VRHN8/103-9411210-6787060?v=glance&n=130&v=glance)*
which packages all three of these movies. Perhaps the only movie missing
is [Krush Groove](http://imdb.com/title/tt0089444/) (which I admit, I
never saw).

This is one chapter in the history of hip-hop and breakdance. Learn your
roots, foo!
