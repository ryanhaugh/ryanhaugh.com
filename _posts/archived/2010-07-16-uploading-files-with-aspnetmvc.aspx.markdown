I wanted to confirm something about how to upload a file or set of files
with ASP.NET MVC and the first search result for the phrase “uploading a
file with asp.net mvc” is [Scott Hanselman’s blog
post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ABackToBasicsCaseStudyImplementingHTTPFileUploadWithASPNETMVCIncludingTestsAndMocks.aspx "Implementing HTTP File Upload")
on the topic.

His blog post is very thorough and helps provide a great understanding
of what’s happening under the hood. The only complaint I have is that
the code could be much simpler since we’ve made improvements to the
ASP.NET MVC 2. I write this blog post in the quixotic hopes of knocking
his post from the \#1 spot.

### Uploading a single file

Let’s start with the view. Here’s a form that will post back to the
current action.

```csharp
<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  
  <label for="file">Filename:</label>
  <input type="file" name="file" id="file" />

  <input type="submit" />
</form>
```

Here’s the action method that this view will post to which saves the
file into a directory in the App\_Data folder named “uploads”.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Index(HttpPostedFileBase file) {
            
  if (file.ContentLength > 0) {
    var fileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
    var path = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/uploads"), fileName);
    file.SaveAs(path);
  }
            
  return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

Notice that the argument to the action method is an instance of
`HttpPostedFileBase`. ASP.NET MVC 2 introduces a new value providers
feature which [I’ve covered
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/04/15/sending-json-to-an-asp-net-mvc-action-method-argument.aspx "Sending Json").

In this case, there’s a default value provider called the
`HttpFileCollectionValueProvider` which supplies the uploaded files to
the model binder.Also notice that the argument name, *file*, is the same
name as the name of the file input. This is important for the model
binder to match up the uploaded file to the action method argument.

Uploading multiple files
------------------------

In this scenario, we want to upload a set of files. We can simply have
multiple file inputs all with the same name.

```csharp
<form action="" method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    
  <label for="file1">Filename:</label>
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file1" />
  
  <label for="file2">Filename:</label>
  <input type="file" name="files" id="file2" />

  <input type="submit"  />
</form>
```

Now, we just tweak our controller action to accept an `IEnumerable` of
`HttpPostedFileBase` instances. Once again, notice that the argument
name matches the name of the file inputs.

```csharp
[HttpPost]
public ActionResult Index(IEnumerable<HttpPostedFileBase> files) {
  foreach (var file in files) {
    if (file.ContentLength > 0) {
      var fileName = Path.GetFileName(file.FileName);
      var path = Path.Combine(Server.MapPath("~/App_Data/uploads"), fileName);
      file.SaveAs(path);
    }
  }
  return RedirectToAction("Index");
}
```

Yes, it’s that easy. :)
