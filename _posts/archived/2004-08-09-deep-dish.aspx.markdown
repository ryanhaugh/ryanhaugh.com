No, I'm not talking about Pizza from Chicago. I'm talking about this
dynamic duo:

As you can see at the bottom, I'm listening to their remix of Dido's
*Thank You* which won a Grammy. These guys are one of my favorite
electronica bands out there. They're much more in the deep funky
progressive house area. Somewhat dark, without being too malicious. I
highly recommend you check them out. Especially this Dido remix.
