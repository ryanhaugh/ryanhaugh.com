Interesting [post on the 37Signals
blog](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/google_does_not_render_resistance_futile.php "Google does not render resistance futile")
regarding competing against Google.  Harb references a post by [Paul
Graham](http://paulgraham.infogami.com/blog/kiko "Paul Graham on Google and Kiko") about
Kiko’s founders putting their site up on eBay. 

Long story short, it sounds like Kiko came out with a web-based
calendar, but when Google came out with theirs, Kiko’s growth stopped,
users defected, and they threw in the towel.

Paul’s solution is to *stay out of Google’s way*.

Kind of sounds like what could happen
to [Blogjet](http://blogjet.com/ "Blogjet") with the advent of [Windows
Live Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/).  However Harb
offers a more optimistic take on the events.

Perhaps the same can be said for the creator of BlogJet vs Microsoft.  I
was chatting with [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon's Blog") about this and
I suggested this would really hurt BlogJet, perhaps even spell its
demise in the long run.  How does a tiny company challenge Microsoft and
compete against a free product?  Jon was more optimistic and pointed to
SourceGear as a counterexample.

I was not convinced.  Writing software to post to a blog has a much
lower bar of entry compared to a source control system.  But so does
writing a Calendar app, no?

It will be interesting to see if
[Dmitry](http://www.blogjet.com/blog/ "Dmitry Chestnykh") can **competes
differently** and come out with some creative means to keep Blogjet
viable.  Good luck.
