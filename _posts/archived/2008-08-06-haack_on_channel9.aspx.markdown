Recently, Adam Kinney came by my office to [interview me for a Channel
9](http://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Continuum/MVCPreview4/ "MVC Preview 4")
episode discussing ASP.NET MVC CodePlex Preview 4.

I’ve known Adam for a long time, even before he joined Microsoft. I
think we met (in person) at Tech-Ed 2003.

In any case, we talk a bit about ASP.NET MVC and Preview 4, all the
while I tried very hard not to put my foot in my mouth. At the end there
are some outtakes of me impersonating Scott Hanselman doing an
impersonation of Sean Conery. That wasn’t to make fun of Scott, but
totally out of love and respect. ;)

### On Gaming

In the interview, I mentioned that I used to work at a skill gaming
company called SkillJam which is no longer around. We had a tournament
engine that allowed users to play games of skill for money. I worked on
the back-end technologies such as our [mobile gaming
infrastructure](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/08/mobile-phone-gaming.aspx "Mobile Phone Gaming")
which was well reviewed by
[GameSpot](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/06/great-review-on-gamespot.aspx "GameSpot Review").

SkillJam is no longer around as it was bought by [FUN
Technologies](http://www.funtechnologies.com/ "Fun Technologies") (yes,
I literally worked for “Fun” back then) and subsumed into [World
Winner](http://www.worldwinner.com/ "World Winner").

In any case, one of the sharpest coworkers that I worked with there went
out on his own to start a new game development company called
[CasualCafe](http://apps.facebook.com/casualcafe/ "Casual Cafe"). This
guy was the one who lived in the world of writing low-level C++ code,
anti-cheat techniques, and game engines. If you are into the genre of
“Casual Games” (such as Bejewelled, Solitaire, etc…) be sure to check it
out.

### Books on My Shelf

Via Twitter, [James Avery](http://infozerk.com/ "James Avery") was more
interested in the books on my shelf than what I was saying (I don’t
blame him). In case you were wondering, here’s a partial list:

-   [Facts and Fallacies of Software
    Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321117425?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321117425 "Facts and Fallacies")
    Highly recommended look at common myths and facts of software
    engineering. The facts are supported by research and data.
-   [Code
    Complete](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0735619670?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0735619670 "Code Complete 2nd Edition")
    Never leave home without it. Seriously.
-   [Don’t Make Me
    Think!](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321344758 "Don't Make Me Think")
    A classic on web usability.
-   [User Interface Design for
    Programmers](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1893115941?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1893115941 "UI for Programmers")
    A more general book on usability by Joel Spolsky.
-   [Framework Design
    Guidelines](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321246756?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321246756 "FDG")
    Love it or hate it, the annotations alone are worthwhile.
-   [Agile Web Development With
    Rails](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0977616630?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0977616630 "Agile Web Development With Rails")
    A bit outdated, but at the time, this helped me immensely getting up
    to speed at Koders.
-   [Mastering Regular
    Expressions](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596528124?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596528124 "Mastering Regular Expressions")
    THE book on regular expressions. It lives up to its title.

There are other books up there, but these are the ones I’ve read
cover-to-cover and can recommend.
