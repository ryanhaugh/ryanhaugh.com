that Windows XP SP2 can do this via the new firewall, but look again.
The firewall built into XP blocks **incoming** traffic, not outgoing. My
guess is that feature will come with SP3. For now, I recommend the free
version of
[ZoneAlarm](http://www.zonelabs.com/store/content/catalog/products/sku_list_za.jsp?lid=nav_za)
which is perennially considered by many to be the best desktop firewall
software out there. It will notify you when an application tries to send
an outgoing message to the internet and its quite easy to configure.
