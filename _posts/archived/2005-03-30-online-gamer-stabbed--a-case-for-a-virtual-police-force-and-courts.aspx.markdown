Did you read about the Chinese [online gamer who stabbed a
competitor](http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&u=/nm/life_china_sabre_dc)
after the competitor sold his borrowed virtual sword?

One phrase in the article caught my attention:

> But other experts are calling for caution. "The 'assets' of one player
> could mean nothing to others as they are by nature just data created
> by game providers," a lawyer for a Shanghai-based Internet game
> company was quoted as saying.

I don't buy that argument as I told my friend Walter who [wrote about
this](http://spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/Blog/cns!1pCvw_V_FwCgTXneX4GXlXLw!208.entry)
from a legal perspective. The argument that the "assets" of one player
means nothing to others just because its virtual actually applies to all
property, physical or otherwise.

If society in general decides that virtual assets are somehow inherently
different than physical assets, then it behooves the gaming companies to
create a microcosm of the real world within the virtual space. Think
about it for a second. If I'm paying \$20 to \$40 a month (not to
mention my time) to play some online game, I want to make sure that if
someone swindles me of property that has real-world market value, I have
some means for recompense.

Can you picture it? Using a portion of the online gaming fees, these
gaming companies might neet do hire virtual police force where
characters can resolve violations of the "law". Likewise you might start
a character to be a virtual lawyer to handle arbitration between
characters. Heck, I'd probably create a character and provide consulting
work within the virtual market

The problem with this of course is that a game world is not meant to be
like the real world. For example most MMORPGs involve a lot of killing.
Some even allow killing other characters. If my character were to kill
your character and then take your stuff, should you be able to sue me
for the real-world material value of your character's possesions? That
would certainly put a damper on the game.

I don't think many game companies anticipated that virtual assets would
command such real world market value and did not prepare for thes
scenarios. It seems to me that they ought to require waivers from
players indemnifying all other players and the company from any loss
involving virtual assets. Either that, or put an in-game arbitration
system in place and have players sign waivers stating they agree to
resolve disputes via the in-game system first.
