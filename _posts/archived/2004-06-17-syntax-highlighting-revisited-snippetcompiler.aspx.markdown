[![Snippet

Syntax Highlighting, [Daniel Turini](http://dturini.blogspot.com/)
pointed out that
[SnippetCompiler](http://www.sliver.com/dotnet/SnippetCompiler) has the
ability to export code to the clipboard (and to a file) as HTML.

Snippet Compiler has a lot of nice features and is a welcome addition to
my toolbox, but purely for syntax highlighting, it has a few
disadvantages compared to the manoli.net website I [mentioned
previously](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/16/636.aspx). First of
all, although you can view snippets with line numbers, the line numbers
aren't exported to HTML like Manoli does. Secondly, Manoli handles
XML/HTML along with C\# and VB, while SnippetCompiler seems to do well
only with C\# and VB.NET. Lastly, Manoli uses CSS for styling and you
can have it embed the CSS definitions in the generated HTML, or
reference the provided stylesheet. This is a really nice feature.

One thing I do like about the SnippetCompiler is how the summary tags in
the comments are gray while the actual comment is green. That's a nice
touch.
