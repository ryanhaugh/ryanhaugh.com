![Rate This Content Screen Shot](/images/RateThisItem.gif)\
Scott Mitchell writes about a neat feature he created for .TEXT in [this
article](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/1028.aspx) and [this
follow up article](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/1050.aspx).
Basically, it adds a "Rate This Content" control to each blog entry much
like [MSDN](http://msdn.microsoft.com/) has for each of its articles.
This allows you to let the author know just how much you love or hate
the article, and hopefully provides some constructive (or if not
constructive, at least humorous) criticism.

I'd love to take this one step further. Currently, when a blog supports
one the [CommentAPI](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9), RSS Bandit
allows you to comment on a post via a "Post Reply" context menu item.
It'd be neat to create a "Rate This Item" API so that aggregators can
allow users to rate a blog entry if the blog supports a ratings system.
What do you think?
