Well my Page Rank (and traffic numbers) are suddenly down as of last
week. It wasn’t a gradual drop as one would expect, but more of a rapid
freefall descent like any stock I’ve ever purchased.

But this post isn’t here to whine. I’m just giving a bit of thanks and
link love to those who linked to my blog in order to help my PageRank.
It’s reminiscent of a modern day “HaackedAID” benefit. (*For the price
of one link a day, you too can join us to help helpless bloggers like
Haacked one day have hope to emerge from the basement of Google PageRank
and live a normal and overly obsessed about numbers blogger life. Won’t
you help. This is Sally Struthers signing off.*).

So as I said, I really appreciate those of you who linked to me to help.
It was very kind. It didn’t work.

Nonetheless, throw some link love right back atcha, but in Romper Room
style.

I see [Scott Cadillac](http://custom.softwarefor.net/), and there’s
[Jayson](http://jaysonknight.com/blog/), and, oh look over there! It’s
[Ryan
Rinaldi](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/ryan/archive/2005/08/25/9129.aspx)
and [Barry](http://idunno.org/).

*Ummm... this is what happens when you drink very very strong coffee.
You start bringing back bad memories of Romper Room.*
