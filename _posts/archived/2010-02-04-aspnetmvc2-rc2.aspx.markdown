UPDATE: This blog post is out-of date. We released the RTM of ASP.NET
MVC 2 in March 2010. Read [about it
here](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/11/aspnet-mvc2-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM").

Today I’m pleased to announce the availability of Release Candidate 2
for ASP.NET MVC 2.

[![thumbs-up](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/ASP.NETMVC2RC2Released_E8E6/thumbs-up_3.jpg "thumbs-up")](http://www.flickr.com/photos/89186997@N00/3396410350/ "thumbs up by richkidsunite - creative commons by attribution")After
receiving feedback from our last release candidate back in December, we
decided it would be prudent to have one more release candidate that
incorporated the feedback. You can **[read the release
notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=182482 "ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 2 Release Notes")**
for everything that changed, there’s not a whole lot.

The biggest change in this release was described by Brad Wilson in his
blog post on [Input Validation vs. Model Validation in ASP.NET
MVC](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/blog/2010/01/input-validation-vs-model-validation-in-aspnet-mvc.html "Input Validation vs Model Validation").
Also included in this release are an assortment of bug fixes and
performance improvements.

The window to provide feedback on this release is going to be very short
as we are closing in on the RTM. If you want to provide input into this
release, please do take the bits for a spin as soon as possible. I’m
pretty excited about this release as I can see the end of the tunnel
fast approaching. :)

At this point, we’ll only be taking recall class bugs for ASP.NET MVC 2.
All other bug reports will be filed against ASP.NET MVC 3. Sometime in
the near future, I’ll start sharing some of our planning around that.
How exciting!

Oh, and if you missed the link to the Download Details page at the
beginning of this post, [**here it is
again**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=182483 "ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 2 Download Details").

We also posted the **[source code and futures assembly on our Codeplex
Site](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=39978 "ASP.NET MVC 2 RC 2 Source Code")**.
