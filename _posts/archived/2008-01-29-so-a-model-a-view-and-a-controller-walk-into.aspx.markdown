At the risk of embarrassing myself and eliciting more groans, I am going
to share a joke I made up for my [Code Camp
talk](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/01/28/seattle-code-camp-wrapup.aspx "Seattle Code Camp").
I was inspired to come up with some humor based on Jeff’s [Sesame Street
Presentation
Rule](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001040.html "Sesame Street Presentation")
post. I fully understand his post was addressing something deeper than
simply telling a gratuitous joke in the presentation.

The context is that I just finished explaining the various dependencies
between the Model, View, and Controller within the MVC pattern.

UPDATE: Updating this joke as the feedback comes in. The original is at
the bottom.

> So a Model, a View, and a Controller walk into a bar and sit down to

> than the others and turns to the Model and says,

> “Can you give me a ride home tonight? I know I always burden you with

Ba dum dum.

I am refining it a bit and posting it here in the hopes that I can
improve upon it with your feedback. :)

Here’s the original as a point of comparison.

Thanks for the feedback!
