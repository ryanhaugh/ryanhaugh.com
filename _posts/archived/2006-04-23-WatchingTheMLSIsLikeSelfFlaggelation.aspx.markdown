This weekend I went to see the Los Angeles Galaxy play with my wife and
some friends. What a disappointing game that was! Despite having
discount tickets (only \$10) we felt totally ripped off. During the
whole game, my teammate and I were joking that “Ronaldinho would’ve made
that play.”

My wife and I now have a new song entitled *What would Ronaldinho do?*
sung to the tune of South Park’s *What would Brian Boitana do?* I think
I will have to start passing out WWRD bracelets.

The Galaxy are playing boring lackluster soccer so far this season. The
game was a scoreless tie till the Columbus Crew scored in injury time
with an ugly goal. Fugly. It takes FC Barcelona visiting to play a
Mexican team for us to get us some decent soccer around here. I am
hoping to get some tickets to that.

Speaking of the big R, have you seen the amazing Nike commercial
featuring Ronaldinho as a kid playing in the Brazillian futsal leagues
(like soccer but indoor with smaller teams and ball). It splices scenes
of him playing as a kid with him now. He was amazing back then. [Here it

YouTube.

This was a soccer weekend for me. I had a fantastic game on Saturday in
which we won five to one, only to be followed by a terrible three zero
loss on Sunday. I need to quit playing on Sundays, because it always
erases the good feelings created on Saturday.
