![](/images/steven_hawking.jpg)According to [this
article](http://news.com.au/common/story_page/0,4057,9075388%5E13780,00.html),
Steven Hawking's wife has been questioned by British detectives over
claims that she has been assaulting the brainy cosmologist (no, a
cosmologist is not someone who writes for Cosmo).

If she is guilty, Boo hiss hiss! This is no way to treat the most famous
physicist since Einstein!

In support and honor of Mr. Hawking, I will bring back a long lost site
from the archive and link you to [MC Hawking's
Crib](http://www.mchawking.com/) where you can hear him bust a rap in a
imploding quasar's ass.
