Just wondering, but are there any non-techie readers of this blog
(besides my wife of course)? The reason I ask is that I am noticing that
I am writing less and less about whatâ€™s going on in my life. In part,
because I think my audience is almost entirely tech readers and google
searchers.

Not that I would suddenly turn this blog into an on the Oprah couch
tell-all blog if you were all non-geeks. Seriously.
