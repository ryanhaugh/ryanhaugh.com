I have a really old Kodak photography book laying around that delivers
various tips for how to advance from your typical crapola™ snapshots
into something worth boring your friends with on
[Flickr](http://flickr.com/) after your [last
vacation](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/11/29/11266.aspx).

It is really too bad that I’ve forgotten everything the book had to say.
Fortunately Robb Allen is starting a series of Photography lessons for
our general photography improvement. [Read lesson
1](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2006/01/07/4379.aspx) and
start taking better pics. Your friends and family will thank you for it.

My personal tip is to buy the biggest memory card you can afford, fill
that sucker up when taking pictures, and delete vigorously before
showing showing the pics off. Memory is getting cheaper and is way
cheaper than paying for film and developing. Why settle for just one
chance to get a great shot of your kid picking his nose when you can get
three and keep the best. The odds are in your favor.

Just remember to delete vigorously because while memory is cheap, time
isn’t.
