Yes folks, it's true. After working a while in VS.NET, it suddenly stops
and asks if I'd like to send an error report to Microsoft. Then it shuts
down. Almost like clockwork. This creates a very good time for me to
take a break, stretch, and meditate on how much work I just lost as I
was just about to hit the save icon.
