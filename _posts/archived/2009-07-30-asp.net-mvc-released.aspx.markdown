UPDATE: This post is outdated. ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM was [released in
March](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/03/11/aspnet-mvc2-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 RTM").

Four and a half months after my team [released ASP.NET MVC
1.0](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/03/18/aspnet-mvc-rtw.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 1.0"),
I am very happy to announce that the release of our first Preview of
version 2 of ASP.NET MVC is now [**available for
download**](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154409 "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1").
Go download it immediately and enjoy its coolness. :) Don’t be afraid to
install it as it will sit nicely side-by-side with ASP.NET 1.0.

The **[release
notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154411 "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1 Release Notes")**
provide more details on what’s in this release and I’ve also updated the
[**Roadmap on
CodePlex**](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?title=Road%20Map&referringTitle=Home "ASP.NET MVC Roadmap"),
which describes the work we want to do in Preview 2 and beyond.

After shipping ASP.NET MVC 1.0, the team and I spent time pitching in on
ASP.NET 4 which was a nice diversion for me personally as I got a chance
to work on something different for a while and it let ideas for ASP.NET
MVC 2 percolate.

But now I’m very happy to be back in the saddle going full bore working
on ASP.NET MVC again. As mentioned in the roadmap and elsewhere, ASP.NET
MVC 2 will run on both ASP.NET 3.5 SP1 and ASP.NET 4. We will be
shipping ASP.NET MVC 2 in the box with Visual Studio 2010 and be making
a separate installer for Visual Studio 2008 SP 1 available via download.

### Templated Helpers

One of my favorite new additions in Preview 1 is what we call the
Templated Helpers. You can watch [a short Channel 9
Video](http://channel9.msdn.com/posts/Glucose/Hanselminutes-on-9-ASPNET-MVC-2-Preview-1-with-Phil-Haack-and-Virtual-Scott/ "Haack on Templated Helpers")
that Scott Hanselman filmed of me giving a last minute impromptu demo of
Templated Helpers.

Templated Helpers allow you to automatically associate templates for
editing and displaying values base on the data type. For example, a date
picker UI element can be automatically rendered every time data of type
System.DateTime is used.

If you’re familiar with [Field Templates in ASP.NET Dynamic
Data](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc488523.aspx "ASP.NET Dynamic Data Field Templates Overview"),
then this is very similar to that, but specific to ASP.NET MVC.

To find out more about the helpers, check out the pre-release
documentation for a [walkthrough of using Templated
Helpers](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=159062 "Walkthrough of Templated Helpers").

We also include support for Areas and Data Annotations, along with
various bug fixes and minor API improvements. Everything is detailed in
the [Release
Notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=154411 "Release Notes").

### The Team

I have to say, I really like being a part of a team that I feel is
working very well together and am proud of the work they’ve done. Some
of them already have blogs such as [Eilon (rarely updated)
and](http://weblogs.asp.net/leftslipper/ "Eilon's Blog")[Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson's Blog"). The QA
guys [recently started a podcast](http://codingqa.com/ "CodingQA"). But
others (Levi, looking at you) really need to start a blog. ;) Great work
fellas!

**Note**: the official name of this version of the product is ASP.NET
MVC 2 and not ASP.NET MVC 2.0 as some might expect. Maybe it’s part of a
new marketing initiative to get rid of dots in product names. I guess
they didn’t read my [Law of Demeter
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/07/14/law-of-demeter-dot-counting.aspx "Law of Demeter")
to understand it’s not about reducing dots ;).
