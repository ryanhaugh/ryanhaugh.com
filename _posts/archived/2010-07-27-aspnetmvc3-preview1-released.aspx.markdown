UPDATE: This post is a out of date. We recently released the [Release
Candidate for ASP.NET MVC
3](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/11/09/asp-net-mvc-3-release-candidate.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 RC Released").

Feels like just yesterday that we released ASP.NET MVC 2 to the world
and here I am already talking about an early preview. In a way, we’re
right on schedule. It was almost exactly a year ago that we released
[Preview 1 of ASP.NET MVC
2](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/07/30/asp.net-mvc-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 2 Preview 1").

Today I’m happy to announce that **[ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 is available
for
download](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=157073 "Download Details page for ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1")**.
Give it a try out and [let us know what you
think](http://forums.asp.net/1146.aspx "ASP.NET MVC Forums"). Some key
notes before you give it a whirl:

-   ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 tooling requires Visual Studio 2010
-   ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1 runtime requires the ASP.NET 4 runtime

As usual, to find out what’s in this release, [check out the release
notes](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=191783 "Release Notes").
Also at the recent [MVCConf](http://mvcconf.com/ "MVC Conference"), a
virtual conference about ASP.NET MVC, I [recorded a
talk](http://www.viddler.com/explore/mvcconf/videos/4/ "ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1")
that provided a sneak peek at ASP.NET MVC 3 Preview 1. The audio quality
isn’t great, but I do demo some of the key new features so be sure to
check it out.

So what’s in this release that I’m excited about? Here’s a small
sampling:

-   Razor View Engine which [ScottGu wrote about
    recently](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2010/07/02/introducing-razor.aspx "Razor View Engine").
    Note that for Preview 1, we only support the C\# version (CSHTML).
    IN later previews, we will add support for the VB.NET version
    (VBHTML). Also, Intellisense support for Razor syntax in Visual
    Studio 2010 will be released later.
-   Dependency Injection hooks using service locator interface. [Brad
    Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson's Blog") should
    have a few blog posts on this over the next few days.
-   Support for .NET 4 Data Annotation and Validation attributes.
-   Add View dialog support for multiple view engines including custom
    view engines.
-   Global Action Filters

In the next few days you should see more details about each of these
areas start to show up in various blog posts. I’ll try to keep this blog
post updated with relevant blog posts so you can find them all. Enjoy!
