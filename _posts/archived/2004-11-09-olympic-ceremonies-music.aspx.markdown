![Parade of the
Athletes](http://haacked.com/images/ParadeOfTheAthletes.jpg)When the
Olympics occurred, one of my favorite DJs spun for the opening
ceremonies. Unfortunately I missed it, but I had heard good buzz about
his performance. Now he’s come out with a CD called "[Parade of the
Athletes](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/B000641ZKO/ref=pe_al_s_e9/002-3789674-5155237?v=glance&s=music#product-details "Parade of The Athletes")".
I have a feeling that if you liked the music he played for the Olympics,
you’ll like this cd.
