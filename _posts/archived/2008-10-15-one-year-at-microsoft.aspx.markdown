Today marks my one year anniversary at Microsoft. Tradition dictates
that I bring in a pound of M&Ms for each year that I’ve been an
employee. I’m going to buck that trend (because I like bucking things)
and bring in 1 kilo of Japanese candies. Since I just returned from a
trip to Japan and it is also customary to bring gifts back from a trip,
this ends up killing two birds with one stone. Software is not the only
place to apply the [DRY
principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DRY_code "Don't Repeat Yourself").

Looking back at when I [first was
hired](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/09/17/why-is-microsoft-removing-my-mvp-status.aspx "Losing my MVP status")
and later at my first days when I [drank from the
firehose](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/26/drinking-from-the-firehose.aspx "Drinking from the firehose"),
working here feels a lot different now than it did then. I finally feel
a lot more settled at Microsoft, though there are still many days when I
feel like a new hire, or even as a bit of an outsider.

The other day in an IM chat with [Scott
Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog"), he made
some comment about how us *Microsofties* love our `app_codeApp_Data`
directory. Hey man, his badge is just as blue as mine, but I understand
the sentiment. Guys like us are referred to as “industry hires” as
opposed to college hires. Many of the developers here happen to be
college hires. The theory is that industry hires will bring a fresh
perspective, but I think we just mostly get in everyone’s way and stir
up trouble.

### So what have I done in this past year?

I’ve spoken at five conferences (Tech-Ed Hong Kong, TechReady 6 and 7,
DevScovery, MVP Global Summit) and two internal TAP events. I’ve
attended two other conferences (Mix 08, Google IO). For the most part, I
think I’ve gotten over my stage fright, which was intense in the
beginning. Hopefully, I’ve also improved as a speaker, but I still
cringe when I hear myself speak.

I’ve been involved in around four or five [ASP.NET
MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website") preview releases (I’ve
lost count) as well as the release of ASP.NET 3.5 SP1 (ASP.NET Routing
feature) and a CodePlex release of ASP.NET Dynamic Languages support.
I’m particularly excited about taking ownership of our DLR support for
ASP.NET and hope that in the new year I can push that forward.

I’ve also been involved in division wide efforts to help other teams
understand Test Driven Development so that our products moving forward
will take TDD into consideration in the design of their products.

Amidst all this, I even found some time to get Subtext 2.0 out the door.
Open source software remains a passion for me and I’m very excited about
all the progressive changes that have happened here in the past year
from [us including
JQuery](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/09/30/jquery-and-asp.net-mvc.aspx "JQuery and ASP.NET MVC")
in our offering to the opening up of licensing in various products [such
as
MEF](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/archive/2008/10/02/mef-going-ms-pl-the-little-engine-that-could.aspx "MEF MS-PL").

### What’s Next For Me?

I think I’ll stay here for a while. My wife and I really like it in
Bellevue and so far, I’m really enjoying the work here. In the next
year, I’ll be taking on more responsibilities. I’ll be taking ownership
for driving our TDD efforts, hoping to obtain a few small wins here and
there. Baby steps.

I’ll also keep driving ASP.NET MVC towards RTM and put together a plan
and strategy together for our Dynamic Languages effort.

I’m still trying to wrap my head around the PM role here at Microsoft.
My managers never fail to remind me that while I’m doing fine at the
technical and community side of things, I really need to improve the
project management side of things. Understandable, I’m doing great at
the fun stuff, but not so good at the part that I don’t find so fun. :)

In any case, [as I did
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/12/13/thank-you-for-helping-me-with-my-job-with-asp.net.aspx "Thank you"),
I want to thank many of you for helping me with my job. There have been
many large design improvements to ASP.NET MVC that quite possibly
wouldn’t have happened were it not for your constant feedback. It really
is appreciated.
