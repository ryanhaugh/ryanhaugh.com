[Randy](http://www.kbcafe.com/iBLOGthere4iM/) posts this summary list of
[tips from challies.com](http://www.challies.com/archives/001128.php).
It’s a nice list to be sure, but I’ve always been partial to a big fat
wad of cash.

> 1.  Visit - This one may seem obvious, but to support your favorite
>     blogger, visit his (or her) site.
> 2.  Comment - When you visit, why not leave a comment?
> 3.  link - If you have a website or blog of your own, link to your
>     favorite bloggers every now and then.
> 4.  Encourage - Encourage your favorite blogger every now and then.
> 5.  Prayer - This is the support bloggers receive that they may never
>     know about.
> 6.  Clicking Advertisement *-Randy: Click fraud? Not encouraged.*
> 7.  Affiliates - Many bloggers have affiliate accounts with various
>     companies. The most popular of these is Amazon.
> 8.  Products - Many bloggers offer products through their sites.
> 9.  Tip Jar - Many bloggers have what is known as a tip jar. These are
>     the little buttons on their site that say "Donate," "click to
>     give" or something similar.
