I was recently approached by some people I know purely through blogging
and IM conversations to write on a topic for a book they are putting
together. Of course I was honored and appreciative that they thought of
me, even after finding out there would be no payment for the work. Doh!

In any case, I am taking their lead by not discussing what the book is
about, except to say that I am writing about tools that I use all the
time. In attempting to cover these tools in sufficient detail, I
realized how little I really knew about them. These are software
utilities that I use every day, but as is the case with many tools, I
wasnâ€™t using them to their full capacity. I had quickly learned just
what I needed to know to get stuff done and stopped there. How lazy and
counterproductive of me!

Of course as developers, we all need to find that balance between
spending the time to RTFM and just plowing along and getting to work.
Back in the day, we called this the *Commodore Shuffle* (though I am
sure there are many names for this phenomena). This is the technique of
figuring out how to use a piece of software by playing around with it
and clicking on everything that moves. Unfortunately, this often will
only cover the surface of what a piece of software can do.

I think I will try skimming the manual more often now.
