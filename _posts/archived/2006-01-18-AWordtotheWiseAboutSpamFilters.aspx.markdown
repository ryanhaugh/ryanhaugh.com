![Cash Money](http://haacked.com/images/Money.jpg) If you are going to
talk about a product named “Microsoft Money” you had better make sure
your comment spam filter doesn’t barf on the word “money”. That just
wouldn’t be nice to the helpful people with legitimate comments.

My apologies to those who were frustrated by my blog puking on your well
intentioned comments. I had previously assumed nobody had a good reason
to comment me abount money. But then I started talking about it.
Eeeediot!
