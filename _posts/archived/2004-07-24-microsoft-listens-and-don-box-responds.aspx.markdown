I have to hand it to Microsoft, they really do listen to their
customers. And I don't mean in that head nodding "I hear you but I don't
know what you're saying" kind of way so common with people who really
want you to think they're listening, but have no time for you. I posted
[my question about device
support](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/23/843.aspx) on [Don Box's
Wiki](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Don.HomePage) and here's
his response:

Now, I know this may be out of Don's control, but I think its pertinent
and I might as well ask. The way I see it, a huge source of consumers
for SOA will be mobile devices running on other platforms connecting to
these services. Although J2ME (and BREW etc...) is out of Microsoft's
control, now that Sun and Microsoft are good buddies, can we expect to
see some more collaboration and perhaps even a bit of friendly pressure
on Sun to provide toolkit support for WSE 2.0 now and Indigo near the
time Indigo is released? At the very least Microsoft should be (and I
imagine are) concurrently building Indigo support into the .NET Compact
Framework. Out of curiosity, is that the case? Microsoft says they've
run out of things to buy, but perhaps they should buy or start some
spinoff companies to build toolkits for platforms that do not have
decent support for Web Services. What better way to complete the
chicken-egg problem than to make both?
