![Rhino](http://haacked.com/images/Rhino.jpg)[Ayende](http://www.ayende.com/ "Ayende")
just announced the [release of Rhino Mocks
3.0](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/28/Rhino-Mocks-3.0-Released.aspx "Rhino Mocks").
The downloads are [located
here](http://www.ayende.com/projects/rhino-mocks/downloads.aspx "Downloads").
If you aren’t subscribed to [Ayende’s
blog](http://ayende.com/Blog/ "Ayende’s blog"), I highly recommend it.
This guy never sleeps and churns out code like a tornado.

Ever since I discovered mocking frameworks in general, and especially
Rhino Mocks, mocking has become an essential part of my unit testing
toolkit.

A while ago I wrote a short intro demonstrating [how to write unit tests
for events defined by an
interface](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/23/UsingRhinoMocksToUnitTestEventsOnInterfaces.aspx "Using Rhino Mocks To Unit Test Events on Interfaces").
This small example shows the usefulness of something like Rhino Mocks.

If you’re wondering what the difference between a *mocks*, *stubs*, and
*fakes*, be sure to read [Jeff
Atwood’s](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff Atwood") [Taxonomy of
Pretend
Objects](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000765.html "Test Doubles: A Taxonomy of Pretend Objects").
