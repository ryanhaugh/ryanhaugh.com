If youâ€™re a fan of NPR and KCRW, make sure your voice is heard. The
House will soon vote on budget cuts for public broadcasting and the
issue is being painted as a liberal vs conservative battle.

I believe it is impossible for a person to be truly objective, but as
far as news programs go, I think NPR does a great job of it. I think
both sides of the political spectrum appreciate receiving news without
the sensationalism and fear mongering so prevalent from its puerile
cousin, television news. Here is the letter from KCRW in full...

Message from KCRW General Manager Ruth Seymour\
 Dear KCRW Listener,

I am writing you about an unfolding crises in Congress with regard to
public broadcasting. Proposed funding cuts now before the full House
pose a serious threat to public radio and television -- and to KCRW.

The proposed cut is 25% to KCRW's CPB grant this October and next
October as well. Moreover adding the proposed additional cuts to PBS
childrens' programs and station digital conversion -- the total
reduction adds up to a whopping 45%!

Facility funding, which provided oportunities for stations to modernize
and extend their service has already been zeroed out. These are the
grants that helped KCRW purchase it's first modern transmitter in 1979
and launch NPR's Morning Edition. Later they enabled KCRW to extend
sevice to Ventura and the Antelope Valley.

If these cuts stand, KCRW may lose over \$1,000,000 from its operating
revenue. This would severely impact KCRW's local programming and our
ability to sustain NPR.

The Corporation for Public Broadcasting is the independent organization
created by Congress to support public broadcasting and act as a heat
shield against political interference. But now, ironically, the
Corporation itself is providing the heat.

Chairman Ken Tomlinson has politicized matters by framing the issue of
balance on news programs as liberal versus conservative. We vehemently
object to this characterization which is intended to put public
broadcasting on the defensive and influence program decisions.

-   We cherish our editorial independence and the political diversity of
    the audience we have attracted.
-   We believe in objective journalism, free from political constraints.
-   While we welcome constructive criticism, we reject partisan
    judgements masquerading as impartial analysis.

We can't reverse the funding cuts by ourselves. We need your help.

THE MOST IMPORTANT VOICE IN PUBLIC BROADCASTING IS YOURS!

Please register your opinion by contacting your Congressional
Representative right away.

The full House votes next Thursday or Friday.
