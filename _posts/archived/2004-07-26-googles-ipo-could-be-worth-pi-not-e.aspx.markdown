Google originally wanted to raise \$2,718,281,828, but based on this
article, I predict they'll be closer to \$3,141,592,653. In any case,
that's a big piece of pi. (sorry. really. don't shoot me.)

> LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Google Inc., the world's No. 1 Web search
> provider, said on Monday its highly anticipated initial public offer
> could be worth as much as \$3.3 billion as it prices its stock in a
> range that could value the company at more than \$36 billion.
