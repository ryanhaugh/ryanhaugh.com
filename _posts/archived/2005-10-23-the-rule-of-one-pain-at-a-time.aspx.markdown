Iâ€™ve [talked before
about](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/06/10/590.aspx) the various
physical pains that software developers face on the job. For me, it
seems that my pain likes to migrate around my body. If I have pain, it
almost always seems to be one at a time.

For example, recently, my hands started hurting again, but my back felt
much better. More recently, my hands and back felt good, but my eyes
started bugging out due to eye strain. Now I am back to my back hurting,
and everything else is feeling good. I hope to get back to where
everything feels good, but I think that situation only occurs in the
womb.
