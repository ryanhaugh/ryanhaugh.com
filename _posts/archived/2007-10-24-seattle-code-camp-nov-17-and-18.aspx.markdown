If you live in the Seattle area and like code, talking about code, or
listening to people talk about code, you owe it to yourself to check out
the Seattle Code Camp.

-   **WHO:** You and a bunch of other code junkies
-   **WHAT:** Code Camp Seattle!
-   **WHEN:** November 17, 18 (Sat and Sun) 2007
-   **WHERE:** [DigiPen Institute of
    Technology](http://www.digipen.edu/main/Driving_Directions "Driving Directions"),
    Redmond, WA
-   **WHY:** *Did you not see the first paragraph of this post?*
-   **HOW:** I leave that up to you, but consider car pooling.

Sadly, I won't be able to make this one since I still live in Los
Angeles, but [Jason
Haley](http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx "Jason Haley") and others
will be there. So at the very least, make nice with Jason, get on his
[Interesting
Finds](http://jasonhaley.com/blog/default.aspx "Interesting Finds")
list, and get your blog some exposure.

[Check out the website](http://seattle.codecamp.us/ "Seattle Code Camp")
for more information and a brief FAQ on the code camp ethos.
