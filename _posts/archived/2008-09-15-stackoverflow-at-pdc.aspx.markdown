First of all, I want to congratulate [Jeff
Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror blog"), [Joel
Spolsky](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/ "Joel Spolsky's Blog"), and
their team for the release of
[StackOverflow.com](http://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow"). If you
haven’t tried it out, I highly recommend giving it a shot. Be prepared,
it’s addicting.

Besides my 959 reputation score (which is actually pretty weak), the
other thing about StackOverflow that excites me is that it’s built using
ASP.NET MVC. So far, Jeff has mostly praised the experience of using
ASP.NET MVC, though he’s had a few pain points that I’m now well aware
of. :)

![Stackoverflow
Logo](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/StackOverflowatPDC_EC4F/stackoverflow-logo-250_3.png "Stackoverflow Logo")I
like StackOverflow so much that I asked Jeff to take a 10-15 minute
slice of [my ASP.NET MVC
talk](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "ASP.NET MVC: A New Framework for Building Web Applications")
at PDC to talk about his experiences building StackOverflow using
ASP.NET MVC. Having a demonstration of a real-world application using
ASP.NET MVC will be a nice complement to my overview talk. For the rest
of the talk, he’ll be my code monkey.

By the way, if you’re planning to attend PDC, please navigate to the
[link to my talk and leave a
comment](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "Link to my talk") with
any requests for things you’d love to hear me talk about. I am currently
planning to give the general overview, but perhaps some of you want to
hear more anecdotes from the product team, or more details about
specific features.
