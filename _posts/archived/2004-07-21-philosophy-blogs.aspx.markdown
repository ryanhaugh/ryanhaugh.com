Via [this article](http://msnbc.msn.com/id/5457020/site/newsweek/) in
Newsweek, I found an [interesting blog](http://peasoup.typepad.com/)
geared towards the professional philosopher but open to others with an
interest.

Although some posts such as [Are Deontology, Consequentialism, and
Pluralism the only viable theories of
ethics?](http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2004/07/are_deontology_.html)
will give you a headache just trying to decipher the title, many of the
posts (the aforementioned included) ask very thought provoking questions
such as "[Who Would Suffer the Greater
Misfortune?](http://peasoup.typepad.com/peasoup/2004/07/who_would_suffe.html).
It may not help you track down that elusive threading bug, but it may
help you deal with it philosophically.

One of the contributors is a professor at my [alma mater, Occidental
college](http://www.oxy.edu/).
