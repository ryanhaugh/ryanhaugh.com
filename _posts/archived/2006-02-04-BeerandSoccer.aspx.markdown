![Beer](http://haacked.com/images/Beer.jpg)![Soccer
Ball](http://haacked.com/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg) There is something
really satisfying about having a beer after soccer. Especially when you
can sit down with a Newcastle at the computer and blog about it. I’ve
heard many marathoners say that a beer after a long run is helpful for
replenishing lost carbohydrates. Yeah, that’s the ticket. It’s a health
drink!

This season has been going much better than last season so far. The team
has really picked it up a notch. We started off with a four to zero
thrashing of the other team in our first game. I had a goal in the first
minute of the second half. Fastest goal off of a kickoff I’ve ever been
a part of.

Our second game ended in a two to one victory. Unfortunately that was
marred by a near brawl. One of their teammates known for causing trouble
smacked one of ours in the head after the game was over. Their biggest
guy smacked our smallest guy. Who happened to have a brother on our team
as well.

Here is the thing with brothers. If you smack someone, his brother will
be more upset than the guy receiving the smack. We had to really
struggle to pull everybody apart and keep it from devolving into
anarchy.

This week we have a bye so today we had a friendly against my Saturday
group of pick-up players. It was a long two and a half hour ordeal and I
pretty much ran myself ragged in the midfield. I transitioned to striker
just to take a break in the last half hour, when we were down a couple
players. Unfortunately all that running left me with a slightly pulled
quadricep. Now I can limp around the house and try to muster up some
sympathy. And another beer.
