[Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/archives/dmc-xclef-500-100gb-hard-disk-player-023925.php).
It's bigger and not as nice looking as an iPod, but it is 100 GB.

> The DMC Xclef 500 also supports Ogg Vorbis and even WAVâ€”with a 100GB
> drive, you could start ripping your CDs with no compression at all.
> The 100GB version is \$450 from DMC's online store.
