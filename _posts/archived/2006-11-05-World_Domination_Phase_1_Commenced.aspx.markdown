Total world domination has always been a small goal of mine. It’s not
that I have an unquenchable thirst for power, it just sounds like a
challenging goal and I love challenges.

It’s why I got into software development really. I figure he who
controls the computers, can control the world.

But lately, all this involvement in running a company and an open source
project leaves me very little time for plotting.  I realized I need
help.  I need a minion. Someone to help me carry on my work.  Another
Haacker.  So my wife and I hatched a plan and the incubation process has
begun.

Sometime in June, the incubation period ends and phase 2 will begin as
we add another member to our domination plans.  A baby Haack.

Initially, this new Haacker will actually slow our progress in achieving
world domination as we put him or her through an orientation period.  It
will take some time to get up to speed on essential skills such as
speech, motor coordination, and control over bowel movements - which
we’ve dubbed milestone 1.

But soon enough, our progress will increase as the newest member of our
plot infiltrates the school system sowing the seeds of revolution. 

Yep, good times are ahead.
