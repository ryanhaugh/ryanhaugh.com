[announced](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b56797bf-0bde-40a9-aae2-436bb6515e6e)
the beta version for the Wolverine edition of RSS Bandit (version 1.3.x)
today. You can read his announcement to see some of the nice features it
includes.

I've been feverishly updating the documentation to take into account the
new features and the updated look and feel. Documentation is hard work
when you're trying to keep up with developers as productive as
[Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) and
[Torsten](http://www.rendelmann.info/blog/).

One feature that wasn't announced, but quietly added by yours truly, is
the ability to configure keyboard shortcuts via an XML settings file.
The reason this is not an "announced" feature is that we have yet to
provide any GUI support for configuring these settings. Nor have I
documented the format for these settings or the proper way to change
them.

Assuredly, I will be working to post both documentation as well as a
separate shortcut editing tool soon. For the adventursome, there is a
beta of the editing tool in the Child Projects folder in CVS. You can
edit the settings and save the result in the RSS Bandit Application Data
folder to override the default settings.

In the long term, we'll have to decide if this remains a separate tool
for power users who demand this level of control and are willing to take
the risk, or if it should be added to the main GUI.
