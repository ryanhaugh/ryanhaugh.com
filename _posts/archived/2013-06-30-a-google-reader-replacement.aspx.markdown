Google is [shuttering Google
Reader](http://googlereader.blogspot.com/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html "Google to shut down Google Reader")
in a little over a day (on July 1st, 2013) as I write this. If you use
Google Reader to read my blog, this means you might miss out on my posts
and **I KNOW YOU DON’T WANT THIS!**

Then again, maybe this is finally your chance to make a break, get some
fresh air, stop reading blogs and start creating! I won’t hold it
against you.

But for the rest of you, it’s a good time to find a replacement. Or at
the very least [follow me on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/haacked "Follow Haacked on Twitter") since
I do tweet when I blog.

There’s a lot of Google Reader replacements out there, but only two that
I like so far.

Feedly
------

[Feedly](http://feedly.com "Feedly.com") is gorgeous. There are apps for
many platforms, but the browser works pretty well. Also, you can use
Google to log into it and import your Google Reader feeds. I hope Google
allows exporting to Feedly and other aggregators after July 1st even as
they close down the Google Reader site.

The problem I have with Feedly is that it doesn’t work like Google
Reader. It wouldn’t be so bad if it had a better flow for reading items,
but I find its interface to be quirky and in some cases, unintuitive.
For example, it seems I have to mark items as read by clicking “mark
above articles as read” rather than having it do it automatically like
Reader does after you scroll past it.

This leads me to…

Go Read

[Go Read](http://www.goread.io/ "Go Read") is a late entry into the
list, but there are three important things I really like about it:

1.  It is intended to be a clean and simple clone of Google Reader.
2.  It supports Google Reader’s keyboard shortcuts.
3.  It is open source and [up on
    GitHub](https://github.com/mjibson/goread "goread on github")!

For some more details, check out the [announcement blog
post](http://mattjibson.com/blog/2013/06/26/go-read-open-source-google-reader-clone/ "go read")

[Stack Exchange](http://stackexchange.com/ "Stack Exchange"):

It’s basically Google Reader, but without all the cruft and where you
can send pull requests to improve things!

In fact, there’s already a few pull requests with some nice user
interface polish that should hopefully make it into the site soon.

Despite some false starts, I have it up and running on my machine. I
sent a few pull requests to update the README to help other clueless
folks like me get it set up for hacking on.

So check it out, import your Google Reader feeds, and never miss out on
another Haacked.com post EVER!

*UPDATE:* I forgot to mention what is perhaps the most important reason
for me to prefer Go Read. I don’t want to end up in another Google
Reader situation again and rely on an RSS Aggregator that isn’t a solid
business and might not stick around. At least with an open source
option, I have the code running on my own machine as a backup in a
pinch.
