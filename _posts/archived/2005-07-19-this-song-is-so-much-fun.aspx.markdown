been pretty head down lately with work. But I just had to take a short
break to blog this sweet funky song. The refrain is too catchy. You can
click on the image to the right to sample the CD at Amazon.

I have a feeling he’s not singing about a particular physical location,
but “La La Land” is a common term for Los Angeles. Breathing the air
here will have the same effect as the little pills he mentions.

*Disclaimer* This blog in no way promotes nor condones drug use. It
promotes interesting music. Just assume the lyrics are discussing
aspirin. Very potent aspirin.
