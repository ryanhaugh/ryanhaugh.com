Since I like to stoke the fire of partisanship... This joke was sent to
me by my friend Walter.

> George Bush meets with the Queen of England. He asks her, "Your
> Majesty, how do you run such an efficient government? Are there any
> tips you can give to me?"
>
> "Well," says the Queen, "the most important thing is to surround
> yourself with intelligent people."
>
> "Bush frowns. "But how do I know the people around me are really
> intelligent?"
>
> The Queen takes a sip of tea. "Oh, that's easy. You just ask them to
> answer an intelligent riddle. " The Queen pushes a button on her
> intercom. "Please send Tony Blair in here, would you?"
>
> Tony Blair walks into the room. "Yes, my Queen?"
>
> The Queen smiles. "Answer me this, please, Tony. Your mother and
> father have a child. It is not your brother and it is not your sister.
> Who is it?"
>
> Without pausing for a moment, Tony Blair answers, "That would be me."
>
> "Yes! Very good," says the Queen.
>
> Bush goes back home to ask Dick Cheney, his vice president, the same
> question.
>
> "Dick, answer this for me. Your mother and your father have a child.
> It's not your brother and it's not your sister. Who is it?"
>
> "I'm not sure," says Cheney, " let me get back to you on that one."
>
> Cheney goes to his advisors and asks every one, but none can give him
> an answer. Finally, he ends up in the men's room and recognizes Colin
> Powell's shoes in the next stall. Cheney shouts, "Colin! Can you
> answer this for me? Your mother and father have a child and it's not
> your brother or your sister. Who is it?"
>
> Colin Powell yells back, "That's easy. It's me!"
>
> Cheney smiles, and says, "Thanks!" Then, Cheney goes back to speak
> with Bush. "Say, I did some research and I have the answer to that
> riddle. It's Colin Powell."
>
> Bush gets up, stomps over to Cheney and angrily yells into his face,
> "No, you idiot! It's Tony Blair!"
