Well today I turn old. 33 years old to be exact. A day after
[Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") turns really
old. It seems I’m always following in that guy’s footsteps doesn’t it?

What’s interesting is that [Rob
Conery’s](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery") birthday was just a
few days ago and we’re all recent hires and involved in MVC in some way.
Ok, maybe that isn’t all that interesting after all as it is
statistically insignificant, but I thought I’d mention it anyways.

Clustering is a natural occurrence in random sequences. In fact, when
looking at a sequence in which there is no clustering, you’d pretty much
know it wasn’t random. That’s often what happens when a human tries to
make a sequence look random. The person will tend to spread things
evenly out. But randomness typically forms clusters. Not only that, but
people have a natural tendency to find patterns in sequences and
phenomena that don’t exist. But I digress.

**Code Camp Seattle**

If you’re in the Seattle area this weekend, I’ll be speaking at the
[Seattle Code
Camp](https://seattle.codecamp.us/default.aspx "Seattle Code Camp").
There are several speakers covering various aspects of ASP.NET MVC so I
thought I would try not to overlap and maybe cover a bit of an
introduction, a few techniques, and some Q & A.

In other words, I’m woefully unprepared because I’ve been so slammed
trying to get a plan finalized for MVC that we can talk about. But I’m
enlisting Rob’s help to put together some hopefully worthwhile demos.
All I really need to do is get a designer involved to make something
shiny. ;)

In any case, it’s 2 AM, I need to retire for the evening. I leave you
with this photo of my son after he got ahold of a pen while my wife
wasn’t looking. It was a brief moment, but that’s all he needed to
change his look.
