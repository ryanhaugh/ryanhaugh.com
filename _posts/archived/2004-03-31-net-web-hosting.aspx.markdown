I'm looking to host my site and I'm ready to pay money!!! Does anyone
have any recommendations? Right now, my top choices are WebHost4Life
which has unlimited bandwidth, \$9.95 a month, 150 MB disk space and 150
MB SQL Server space, with a \$19.95 setup fee.

A cheaper option is hostdepartment.com with no setup fee, \$9.95 a
month, and 500 MB disk space, but only 10GB of monthly transfer. I think
10GB should be more than enough, but I've never heard of this company
before.
