A while ago I had the idea of posting a [picture of the
day](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/13/11334.aspx "Bilbao Metro Entrance").
Of course I didn’t mean *every* day, but the title might lead one to
believe so. Therefore in order to reduce confusion, here is the next
photo in my Picture of the Moment series.

[![Geisha
Trio](http://haacked.com/images/GeishaTrio.jpg)](http://flickr.com/photos/haacked/17432593/ "This pic on Flickr")

This is the most favorited and interesting picture according to Flickr
in my Flickr account. So naturally that tells you that it wasn’t me who
took this photo, but my lovely wife while on a trip to Japan. I was
reminded of this picture because someone recently added a comment.

Speaking of Flickr, I love how you can comment specific regions of a
picture by drawing box on the region. If you click on the image, you can
see my feeble attempts at humor by moving your mouse of the photo. My
comments are in sharp contrast to the elegance of three Geisha walking
through a crowd.
