One weakness with many blog engines,
[Subtext](http://haacked.com/ "Subtext Project") included, is that it is
difficult to change the tags and categories for multiple entries at a
time. In general, most blog engines streamline the workflow for tagging
and categorizing a single blog post.

Fortunately, [Marco De
Sanctis](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/Crad/ "Marco De Sanctis"), a friend
of [Simo](http://codeclimber.net.nz/ "Simone Chiaretta") (a core Subtext
Developer) wrote [a nice
application](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/Crad/archive/2007/09/29/a-tool-to-manage-your-blog-categories-and-technorati-tags.aspx "A tool to manage categories")
that you can use to bulk categorize and tag multiple posts. He developed
it using Subtext as a test-bed so it handles the fact that we use the
[rel-tag
microformat](http://microformats.org/wiki/rel-tag "rel-tag microformat") within
the content as our tagging mechanism. Sweeeeet!

Many thanks to Simo for [blogging about
this](http://codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/09/29/Manage-categories-and-tags-of-your-blog.aspx "Managing categories and tags") and
to Marco for writing this.
