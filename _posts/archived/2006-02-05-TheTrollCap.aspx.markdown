![Troll Cap](http://haacked.com/images/TrollCap.gif) I love this idea
from [37 Signals](http://37signals.com/ "37 Signals Website") in
handling abusive comments. Rather than simply deleting them, they will
take the approach of [shaming the abusers with a Troll
Cap](http://37signals.com/svn/archives2/introducing_the_troll_cap.php "Troll Cap Idea").
Though it is doubtful that those who troll will really feel much shame,
at least it serves an educational purpose of teaching others what is
considered trolling behavior.

This is definitely an idea to put in
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") at some
point.
