It wasn’t till 1987 that I experienced my first (and worst) case of
[technolust](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=technolust "Definition of Technolust")
ever. The object that inspired such raw feelings of lust, of course, was
the Commodore
[Amiga](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amiga "Amiga on Wikipedia").

As a lowly [Commodore
128](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_128 "Commodore 128 on Wikipedia")
owner, which was really just a glorified [Commodore
64](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64 "Commodore 64 on Wikipedia")
in a beige case, I bought every issue of the Commodore magazines of the
day.

[![Amiga
500](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PlayTheMostInfluentialAmigaGames_10096/amiga500_thumb1.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PlayTheMostInfluentialAmigaGames_10096/amiga5003.jpg)These
magazines started showing off these lush advertisements of the Commodore
Amiga, boasting of its 4096 colors and 4-channel stereo sound.

I had to have it.

Looking back, I am shocked at how much my lust for the Amiga held sway
over me. I purchased a copy of every Amiga magazine on the newstand,
talked about it incessantly to anyone who would listen, and had vivid
dreams of the Amiga’s amazing graphics capabilities.

And when I finally got my hands on it, it was every bit as good as I had
hoped.

**For many Amiga users at the time, the Amiga was true to its name
(spanish for *female friend)* in that it was the closest thing to a
girlfriend we had.** Give me a break, I was only twelve at the time.

Like having a girlfriend, I spent countless hours with the computer, not
to mention countless dollars on peripherals and upgrades. I remember
hustling for tips at the local
[commissary](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/commissary "Commissary definition.")
in order to upgrade the beast from 512K to 1MB of ram (cost: \$99).

The reason I bring this up is I came across a recent article on the
Wired website entitled [Top 10 Most Influential Amiga
Games](http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/04/gallery_amiga0411? "Top 10 Most Influential Amiga Games - Wired Article"),
which filled me with a rush of nostalgia.

I only had the pleasure to play two of the games listed, [Defender of
the
Crown](http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/04/gallery_amiga0411?slide=2&slideView=2 "Defender of the Crown Summary"),
in which catapulting castles was pure fun, and [SpeedBall
2](http://www.wired.com/gaming/gamingreviews/multimedia/2007/04/gallery_amiga0411?slide=4&slideView=3 "Speedball 2 Summary"),
which probably was responsible for the pile of broken joysticks I
accumulated.

Personally though, I thought [Lords of the Rising
Sun](http://www.cinemaware.com/clsgame_lords.asp "Lords of the Rising Sun")
(also made by Cinemaware) was even better than Defender of the Crown.

The game sequence in which you could snipe advancing siegers using a
first-person bow and arrow with a little red laser point dot was
exhilarating (sadly, I could not find a screenshot).

[![Speedball 1
Screeshot](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PlayTheMostInfluentialAmigaGames_10096/Speedball_thumb1.png)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PlayTheMostInfluentialAmigaGames_10096/Speedball3.png)

I also liked Speedball 1 (shown here) slightly better than 2 because the
side scrolling in 2 always threw me off.

I still have my Amiga 500 gathering dust in a storage cabinet in the
garage. I’ve been meaning to unpack it and see if it still works, but my
home is small and there’s really no room to set it up. I figure there
must be a better way to try out my old games.

### Amiga Emulation!

Digging around, I discovered there’s an active project to create an
Amiga emulator for \*nix called
[UAE](http://uae.coresystems.de/ "Amiga Emulator"). There’s a Windows
port called, not surprisingly,
[WinUAE](http://www.winuae.net/ "Windows port of the UAE Amiga Emulator") (click
for full size).

[![WinUAE

Unfortunately, these projects cannot distribute the Amiga ROM nor its
operating system due to copyright issues. However they do provide
instructions on how to transfer the ROM and operating system over to
your PC on [their
FAQ](http://www.pcguru.plus.com/uae_transfer.html "UAE Faq").

### Amiga Forever

An even easier approach is to simply purchase [Amiga
Forever](http://www.amigaforever.com/ "Amiga Forever") for around forty
bucks. This is an ISO image that contains a preconfigured WinUAE with
the original ROM and operating system files. Amiga Forever is sold by
[Cloanto](http://www.cloanto.com/ "Cloanto") who currently own certain
intellectual property rights to the Amiga.

Amiga Forever comes with several games for the Amiga as well that vary
with the edition purchased. The site also has a [games
section](http://www.amigaforever.com/games/ "Games for the Amiga") in
which they list places to download more games.

For example, the Cinemaware site has disk images for pretty much all of
their games available for free, including [Lords of the Rising
Sun](http://www.cinemaware.com/clsgame_lords.asp?sel=amrom "Lords of the Rising Sun").

### Play Defender of the Crown Immediately

All this talk of Amiga emulation sounds like fun and everything, but
seriously, do I need yet another time sink? If you’re jonesing for some
Amiga gaming now and don’t want to be bothered with emulation, head over
to the Cinemaware website and satiate your Amiga gaming kick by playing
the Flash version of [Defender of the
Crown](http://www.cinemaware.com/play_dotc.asp "Defender of the Crown").
Now about that time sink...

Though I [owned a couple
computers](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/12/what-is-your-blogger-handle.aspx "My computers")
prior to the Amiga, the Amiga is truly the computer that fueled my fire
for computing.
