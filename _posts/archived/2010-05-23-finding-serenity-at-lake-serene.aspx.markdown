The last time I wrote about one of my hiking adventures, it started off
great, but [really didn’t end
well](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/05/24/panic-mt-si.aspx "Fright on Mt Si").
But I survived, so on that scale, yes it *did* end well! It’s a matter
of perspective.

On Saturday, I went on my first hike of the spring to [Lake Serene and
Bridal Veil
Falls](http://www.wta.org/go-hiking/hikes/lake-serene "Lake Serene and Bridal Veil Falls on Washington Trails Association Website").
This hike is really two hikes in one. The main destination is Lake
Serene, but there’s an absolutely wonderful half mile (1 mile round
trip) side trip to the Bridal Veil Falls on the way to Lake Serene.

The trail starts in the small town of Index in the county of
`HomeController` (*sorry, I couldn’t resist*). The entire trail is lush
with greenery as you would expect in the pacific northwest. All along
the trail are many little waterfalls and river crossings like the one
seen here.

The early part of the hike is dominated by moss covered trees and
bushes. Higher up there’s less moss, but just as many trees.

two miles in, there’s a juncture with a sign pointing to the right
towards Bridal Veil Falls. There’s a juncture before this one without
the sign, don’t take that one, take this one.

The roar of the falls served as our guide through the series of
switchbacks leading us to a grand view.

There are two viewing platforms, both with great views of the falls.

The trail is well marked and easy to follow, though it wasn’t without
its occasional obstacle. Nothing a strong man like myself can’t handle
though.

As we got closer to the lake, we captured glimpses of snow capped
mountains jutting into the sky. Near the end of the trail, we rounded a
bend and were greeted with the sight of a calm lake nestled in a snow
covered valley surrounded by jagged peaks. The lake lives up to its
name.

[![IMG\_0376](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/FindingSerenityatLakeSerene_12403/IMG_0376_thumb.jpg "IMG_0376")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/FindingSerenityatLakeSerene_12403/IMG_0376.jpg)We
followed a little trail along the lake to a large rock face where we
were able to get a better view of the trail. There just happened to be a
large group of friends already there, breaking the sense of solitude.

who are we to blame them, the view was beautiful despite the clouds and
rain rolling in right as we got there.

you live in the Seattle or Bellevue area, I highly recommend this hike.
One member of the large group told us that he did the same hike a month
ago and the lake was still frozen over and they sat back and enjoyed the
dramatic site of constant avalanches on the other side of the lake. We
didn’t get the opportunity to witness any.
