It's been said that native Alaskans have 40 or so words for snow.
Roughly translated, they all mean "Fuck! Get the shovel!". It was a
winter wonderland for my wife until I handed her a shovel and led her to
the driveway.

The driveway's full of snow and my husband is full of ...

We both spent the next hour or so working on the driveway, making sure
to take the occasional break.

The only thing missing is a beer in my hand.

And in the end we could enjoy the satisfaction of a job well done.

This is his idea of vacation?

Afterwards we decided to go moose hunting under a dramatic sky.

You can shovel it yourself fool!

We decided to have a look in the woods near by.

This is my idea of a great Alaskan vacation. Shoveling snow and a walk
through the woods jumping into snow drifts.
