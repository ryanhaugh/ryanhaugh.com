Participating in the comments section of particularly interesting blog
posts is a lot of fun and helps build community.  But one of the
annoyances in doing so is that there’s really no good way to keep track
of comments.  Unlike new posts in someone’s RSS Feed, most aggregators
won’t tell you when there is a new comment.

Sure, there is [coComment](http://www.cocomment.com/ "Co Comment"), but
since I like to post comments using my RSS Aggregator via the
[CommentAPI](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9 "The Comment API"),
coComment isn’t such a help there.

But help is on the way.  [Dare
Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ "Dare") recently
*[announced the beta release of
Jubilee](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=b989ee41-b5c8-425f-a882-5ec8e92bb6a7 "Jubilee Beta Installer Available")*,
the code name for RSS Bandit 1.5.  One of the more interesting features
(and my favorite) included in this release is [comment
watching](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=336fc910-afb9-4073-a58a-e2b1812e68f0 "Comment Watching").

When reading an interesting post, you can right click on the post and
select the *Watch Comments* option.  The following screenshot
demonstrates.

In a stroke of [pure
vanity](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/BloggingIsPureVanity.aspx "Blogging Is Pure Vanity"),
I will select a blog post in [Andrew
Stopford’s](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/ "Andrew Stopford, head of MbUnit")
blog that makes a reference to me and click *Watch Comments*.

Now if I wait long enough, someone will eventually leave a comment on
that post.  Of course, why leave it to chance? I went ahead and left a
comment via the browser (*sorry Andrew*).

When RSS Bandit updates, it shows me that someone left a comment in my
*Developers* category by turning that category green.

![New

Expanding that node, I can dig down to the post and read the new
comment.

Of course, this only works for blogs that support
[wfw:commentRss](http://wellformedweb.org/news/wfw_namespace_elements/ "CommentRSS"). 
Unfortunately, one of my favorite blogs,
[CodingHorror](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror"), which happens
to always have lively conversation in the comments section, doesn’t
support it.  Jeff, it’s time to move to
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website")!

Kudos go out to [Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ "Dare") and
[Torsten](http://www.rendelmann.info/blog/ "Torsten")!  Unfortunately,
I’ve been overcommitted and have not been able to contribute to RSS
Bandit lately.
