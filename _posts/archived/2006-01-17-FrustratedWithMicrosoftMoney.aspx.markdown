I really appreciate how Microsoft has really opened up many of its
internal developer groups. I only wish this also applied to more of
their consumer products.

For example, I am trying to set up online services for a bank within
Microsoft Money. My bank allows passwords up to 32 characters. Microsoft
Money allows me to enter 8 characters and that’s it. WTF!? With all this
emphasis on security, you’d think they would support more than 8
characters in a password, especially when the bank does.

So I try going to the support site and there is nothing helpful. Since
my copy is over a year old, I get the lovely option to pay \$35.00 for a
support incident. Heck for that money, I might as well upgrade, but how
do I know this problem is even fixed in the latest versions? I don’t.

So following the support instructions, I head over to the Microsoft
Money community newsgroups to be greeted with the message...

> **Service Temporarily Unavailable**
>
> We apologize for this inconvenience. Please try again later.

Great! It appears there is no way for me to register a complaint or have
someone tell me whether this is fixed in the latest version of Money for
this institution. Maybe I should have bought Quicken.
