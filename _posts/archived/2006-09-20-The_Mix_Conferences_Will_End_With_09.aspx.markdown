I am going to pull a Nostradamus here and predict that the Mix series of
conferences (did I ever tell you how much I loved
[Mix06](http://mix06.com/)?) will end with Mix09 if they even reach that
point.  Why do I make this prediction?  Because Microsoft has Mix07.com,
Mix08.com, and Mix09.com registered, but not Mix10.com (*although
mix010.com is available at the moment*).  ;)

I know, I’m being rather silly.  This evening I was on a Skype chat with
[Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/blog/) and
[Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) asking when is the next
big conference that we should all attend.  Atwood’s reply was Mix07
which is a bit long of a wait, but Ok.  That got me wondering if they
plan on some more Mix conferences afterwards.

If they do, looks like Microsoft has it covered for the next three
years.
