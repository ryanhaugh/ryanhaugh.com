If you happen to be in Asia around October 8-10, I’ll be speaking at
[Tech-Ed Hong
Kong](http://www.microsoft.com/hk/technet/teched2008/ "Tech-Ed HK 2008").
Come by and say hi. I’m giving three talks, one on each day.

Date       | Time                | Talk
-----------|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------
October 8  | 11:45 AM – 1:00 PM  | ASP.NET MVC  - An alternative approach to building Web Applications
October 9  | 11:00 AM – 12:15 PM | Developing Data Driven Applications Using ASP.NET Dynamic Data
October 10 | 9:30 AM – 10:45 AM  | Write better designed code with Test Driven Development

hoping to have a little time after some of my talks to go do a little
sight-seeing around Hong Kong. The trip to Hong Kong is actually a side
trip from Japan where my wife and kid will stay while I go and and speak
at this conference. I’m looking forward to the vacation, but wish I had
scheduled the vacation part *after* the conference, rather than before.
Lesson learned!
