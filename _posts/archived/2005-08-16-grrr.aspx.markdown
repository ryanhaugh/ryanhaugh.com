![Hulk](http://haacked.com/images/hulk.jpg) I just hate it when software
designed to save you countless hours of development work just don’t work
out of the box. Especially when you pay good money for it. I’ve come to
expect a few hiccups here and there with open source software. But
purchasing an expensive rich editing component from a leading vendor,
performing a fresh install, and having buttons popup javascript alert
boxes with debug information is inexcusable. Along with some other
features just plain not working.

It just makes me angry! And you don’ want to see me when I’m angry!
Grrr...
