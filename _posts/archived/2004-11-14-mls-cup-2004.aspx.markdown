![MLS](/images/mls.jpg) I watched DC United take on Kansas City today
for the MLS Cup 2004. The great thing about soccer in the U.S. is that I
can get tickets for the national championshipship the day before for a
decent price. Unfortunately that's also the problem with U.S. soccer.
The quality of play is nowhere near a Premiership game or Bundesliga.

In other soccer news, several of the players I play pick-up with
organized a game (with refs et all) with the league team I just recently
joined. I played with the pick-up team and we were shelled 6 to 3. It
would have been a lot worse had we not had the most phenomenal goalie on
our side. For my part I had an assist and converted a penalty kick.
