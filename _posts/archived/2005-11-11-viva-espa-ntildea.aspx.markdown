So in exactly one week Akumi and I will be on a plane to Spain where it
rains in the plains (please excuse me). We are flying into Madrid in the
morning of the 20^th^ where we’ll stay the night. There, we will meet up
with Akumi’s brother and his wife who will have flown in from Japan a
couple days earlier.

Madrid boasts such great sights as Museo del Prado, Palacio Real and
Plaza Mayor, but the highlight for me will be to visit the place I lived
for three years as a kid. I look forward to seeing how much it changed
and if they ever cleaned up all the grafitti ~~we~~ the local hoodlums
did (hey, this was the time when
[Breakin'](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086998/), [Electric
Boogaloo](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086999/) and [Beat
Streat](http://imdb.com/title/tt0086946/) were out, what was a kid to
do?).

I am almost certain the legend of my fútbol prowess in the Terraza
Grande de los Apartamentos Torrejón will still be mentioned in hushed
tones by the local kids who play there today. Assuming they can contain
their laughter.

From Madrid, we are travelling to Léon for a day and a half, and then
Bilbao for a day and a half. Then we are on a late train to the Catalan
city of Barcelona for four days. No offense to my amigos Madrileños, but
I am really looking forward to beautiful Barcelona. The first time I
visited, I have hazy memories of its beauty. This time I hope to soak it
in more.
