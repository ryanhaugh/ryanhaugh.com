Work on [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Site") 1.9
is progressing well with more and more contributors chipping in. No firm
release date yet, but hopefully soon.  The latest builds are pretty
stable, but there a few more minor bug fixes to get in there. Also we
plan to implement the [MetaWeblog
API](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi "RFC: MetaWeblog API")
`newMediaObject` method in order to better support [Windows Live
Writer](http://windowslivewriter.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D85741BB5E0BE8AA!174.entry "Windows Live Writer Blog Editor").

If you like to live dangerously, you can download one of the [latest
builds](http://haacked.dyndns.org/builds/archive/ "latest Subtext builds")
and give it a twirl.  Please note that link is running off of a VMWare
Server within a Shuttle box in my office/guest room. So if we have
guests, that link is going down for the night.

Of course, should you find a bug, you know [the
drill](http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=137896&atid=739979 "Subtext Bug Report").

In the meanwhile, you can track our status by checking out our
CruiseControl.NET [statistics
page](http://haacked.dyndns.org/ccnet/server/local/project/SubText/ViewStatisticsReport.aspx "Subtext Build Stats"). 
As you can see, our code coverage from unit tests is steadily climbing,
currently at 34%.  There are 23584 lines of code with 1367 FxCop
warnings.
