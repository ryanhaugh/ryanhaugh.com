![Subtext Logo](http://haacked.com/images/SubtextLogo.png) Okay, it is
survey time for all you Subtext users! I would like to know which
Subtext skin you use for your blog. Please leave a comment with the skin
that you use. If you use a custom skin, then just say *Custom*.

I have heard many say that the skins in Subtext look like they were
designed by a developer rather than a designer. Well surprise surprise,
probably because they were! I have a sneaking suspicion that many are
not in use.

The reason this is important to me is that rather than simply continuing
to add more and more skins to Subtext (generating a huge list), I would
like to weed out some of the more drab skins. But instead of deleting
skins, I was thinking I could simply replace them with newer skins that
still fit the spirit of the original skinâ€™s name. For example, I might
replace the skin *White* with a new design that is very light in color
and tone. Make sense?
