![Toshiba M200](/images/m200.jpg) So I am in the market for a Tablet PC
and after a bit of research, the Toshiba Portege M200 is the top
contender for my hard earned dollar.

I'm trying to cut down on the time I spend sitting at a desktop by using
a tablet PC for email, reading and writing blog entries, etc...
Basically non gaming and non development tasks. I think the high
resolution of the M200 makes it a nice choice for reading.

So my main question for you is do you think there's a better Tablet PC
out there (or about to be released) worth me looking at over the M200?
Let me know. Thanks!
