In case you were wondering, I thought I'd tell y'all how it's going.
First of all, I've somehow picked up a southern accent as evidenced by
my use of "y'all".

**Health Insurance**: I thought about limiting our insurance to taking
vitamins and being VERY careful, but apparently that isn't perceived as
being very responsible nor wise. So with that option being, how shall I
put it, stupid, Akumi and I researched the various options out there and
settled on two individual PPO plans with Blue Shield. Getting two
individual plans is cheaper than the cheapest family plan which was
overkill for us. Since we don't have kids and are both relatively young
and relatively healthy, this is a good option for us.

**Errors & Ommisions Insurance:** I've read that this is important for
independent contractors, but as I never make mistakes, I couldn't
imagine that it would apply to me. Even so, I am looking into it. In the
meantime, I had my lawyer buddy
[Walter](http://spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/) give me some wording
for my contract to cap my liability at the amount of the contract. That
was an idea that Jeanine, my former boss at
[Solien](http://www.solien.com/) gave me when I had lunch with her
recently. Right now, none of my contracts require E&O coverage. [Do you
need E&O
coverage?](http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/0,4621,291540,00.html)

**The Contract:** Immediately after quitting my job, the start date for
the bulk of the development work got pushed back to June. This kinda
came out of left field, but that's the risk I took by going independent.
As it stands, it is actually working out nicely as I'm getting a much
needed break. Tomorrow we're getting started on some billable
architecture work. We'll definitely have some work to do, just nothing
full time till June I think. In the meanwhile, I'm pursuing a couple
leads on some short term work to fill in the time in between in case I
need to do so.
