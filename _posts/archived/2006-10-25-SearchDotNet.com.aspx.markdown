[Dan
Appleman](http://www.danappleman.com/ "Dan Appleman, author and developer")
takes the [.NET focused custom search
engine](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/23/My_Very_Own_Search_Engine.aspx ".NET Search Engine")
idea [one step
further](http://www.danappleman.com/?p=49 "Dan Appleman's Search Site")
by grabbing a [great domain
name](http://searchdotnet.com/ "Search DotNet") for his search engine. 
Now why didn’t I think of that!  Sometimes that’s all it takes between a
search engine that will get used alot (his) and one that won't (mine). 
I'd be happy to throw my support over to his, though I’m keeping my
baby.  The one key difference is I plan to leave my search engine open
for others to contribute sites.  Perhaps the two will complement each
other.

And no, the domain name is not the only reason. This guy \*is\* Dan
Appleman after all! He wrote the *[Visual Basic Programmer's Guide to
the Win32
API](http://www.amazon.com/Applemans-Visual-Basic-Programmers-Guide/dp/0672315904 "VB6 Win32 API book")*
which allowed me to feel like a real programmer despite using VB back in
the day.  For this, I owe him a debt of gratitude as I was thus equipped
to stand up to the C++ snobs.

Now we just need someone to help spruce up the logo.
