Working at a [VSIP partner](http://koders.com/ "Koders.com") has its
privileges. I’ll be up in Redmond at the Microsoft Campus for a two day
VSIP Partner Meeting on **August 5^th^ and August 6^th^**. We’ll be
looking at ways to make the Koders Visual Studio plugins provide a great
and well integrated experience.

I’m flying into Seattle on that Sunday to spend time with some friends
and do a bit of sightseeing (*oh look, that’s what rain looks like!*).
Hopefully my schedule won’t be too full so I can butt my head in a few
offices here and there to bother folks and stir up trouble.

### August 7

This is more of a state of mind than a physical location as I’ll be
making an appearance on
[DotNetRocks](http://dotnetrocks.com/ "DotNetRocks")! I hope you enjoy
it.

### October 27th and 28th

I’ll be speaking on [Writing Automated Unit Tests for your
Website](http://www.siliconvalley-codecamp.com/Sessions.aspx#ctl00_ContentPlaceHolder1_Repeater1_ctl14_LabelSessionTitle "Speaking Gig")
with WATIN at the Silicon Valley Code Camp. This’ll be my first time
speaking at a Code Camp so wish me luck. I wanted to give two talks, but
decided to take it easy for my first time.

### November 6-9

I’ll be in attendance and on two panels at the DotNetNuke OpenForce
conference. I’ve mentioned [this one
already](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/22/ill-be-speaking-about-open-source-at-openforce.aspx "Open Force") in
my blog. I’m pretty excited about this one.
