I have a bad habit of writing specs in the future tense. Since the
system I’m spec’ing doesn’t yet exist, it’s so easy for me to fall in
the habit of saying things like:

-   This page will look like this:
-   At this point the system will do this.
-   The system will display that control here.

instead of:

-   This page looks like this:
-   At this point the system does this.
-   The system displays that control here.

So what’s the big deal? Well there’s two big deals. Number one is a
question of written aesthetics and the other is a more practical
consideration. Ok, so they’re not all that BIG a deal. But let me
continue.

Aesthetically speaking, using the present tense sounds more active and
interesting. Remember all those lessons about active voice and passive
voice in high school English? I think it’s made me paranoid.

Secondly, and more importantly, is that after you build the system and
someone comes along and refers to you spec as a piece of documentation,
it sounds kinda funny to say the system "will look like this" when it
already "does look like this". You can argue that the system doesn’t
respond till the user interacts with it so that saying "When the user
clicks here, the system will navigate there" isn’t so off the mark. See
my first point in response to that point. I thank you for your time.
