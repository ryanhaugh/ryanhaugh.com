Given that I've written much of the documentation for [RSS
Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/) on the [documentation
site](http://www.rssbandit.org/docs/) and have spent a lot of time in
the code making a few contributions here and there, I feel a bit
sheepish that I didn't know about this particular feature.

After reading [this
post](http://philringnalda.com/blog/2005/01/a_wee_tweak_to_my_feed_links.php)
(which is one of many discussing how to create one click subscription
links) from [Phil Ringnalda](http://philringnalda.com/blog/) I
discovered that a common way to subscribe to an RSS (or ATOM) feed is to
merely drag the link into your aggregator.

I hadn't seen that described before so I thought I'd try it out with RSS
Bandit and sure enough it works. Sweet! I'll have to add that to the
docs.
