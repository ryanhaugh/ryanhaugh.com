UPDATE: [Luke Wroblewski](http://www.lukew.com/ "Luke Wroblewski")
posted a link in my comments to his [Best Practices for Form Design
PDF](http://www.lukew.com/resources/articles/WebForms_LukeW.pdf "Presentation on Form Design").
It is 100+ pages chock full of good usability information concerning
forms. Thanks Luke!

[James Avery](http://dotavery.com/blog/ ".Avery Blog") writes about the
[Art of Label
Placement](http://dotavery.com/blog/archive/2007/04/11/39026.aspx "The Art of Label Placement")
in which he links to a few great articles on form design and label
placement.

Based on these articles, James decides that non-bold labels above input
fields are the best for usability. Interestingly enough, a non-bold
label just above the form field just happenes to be my personal
preference as well.

And now, I know why.

Matteo Penzo’s research using Eye Tracking provides some empirical
evidence that this arrangement is more usable.
