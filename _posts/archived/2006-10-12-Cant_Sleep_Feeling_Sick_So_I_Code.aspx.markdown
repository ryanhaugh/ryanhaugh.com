Weird how coding on Subtext relaxes me. For the past couple days I’ve
been feeling a bit under the weather and getting worse.  The weird part
is that anytime I try and eat something, there’s a terrible after-taste.
And no, it’s not my breathe.  I couldn’t finish my pizza tonight. 
Pizza!

Anyways, I couldn’t sleep tonight so I figured hacking on some Subtext
code might relax me.  I fixed some bugs and implemented
[FeedBurner](http://feedburner.com/ "FeedBurner") support in Subtext,
using the [DasBlog](http://www.dasblog.net/ "DasBlog") code as a guide,
though the way we implement feeds is much different.  It’ll come out in
the next edition of Subtext.

Unfortunately, it may take me longer to release because although coding
on Subtext feels good when I’m sick, QA testing doesn’t.
