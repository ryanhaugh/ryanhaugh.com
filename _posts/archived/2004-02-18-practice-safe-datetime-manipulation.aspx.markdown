What is the proper way to add three hours to a DateTime for the PST
timezone? Is it this?

```csharp
DateTime d = DateTime.Parse("Oct 26, 2003 12:00:00 AM");d = d.AddHours(3.0);
```

A valiant attempt, but wrong. Instead try this:

```csharp
DateTime d = DateTime.Parse("Oct 26, 2003 12:00:00 AM");
d = d.ToUniversalTime().AddHours(3.0).ToLocalTime();
// displays 10/26/2003 02:00:00 AM which is correct!
Console.WriteLine(d);
```

Why all the
[rigamarole](http://dictionary.reference.com/search?r=2&q=rigamarole "Definition of Rigamarole")
of converting to universal time and back to local time? A little thing
we like to call Daylight savings time. Without the conversion, adding
three hours would have set the time to 3:00 AM which would be wrong.

Realizing this probably would have saved me from many hours of intense
debugging sessions. I remember one particular case with a system of
scripts and tools I set up to analyze the very large log files for a big
client. It hummed along nicely until one fine spring day when it failed
miserably. After an entire day of tracking down the source of the
problem, I finally nailed it down to a scriptâ€™s mishandling of Daylight
Savings.
