While attending [Oredev 2011](http://oredev.org/2011/), I had an
interesting conversation with [Corey
Haines](http://coreyhaines.com/ "Corey Haines") about his perception of
the Ruby community as compared to the .NET community.

One thing he suggested is that the .NET community is seems a bit insular
and self-isolating. He noted that when he attended .NET user groups, he
only saw folks he knew to be .NET developers. But when he attends Ruby,
Scala, NodeJS, Erlang, etc. user groups, he sees many of the same people
at these meet ups.

While I’m not completely against identifying oneself as a .NET developer
to indicate your primary focus, I do see what Corey is getting at.
Rather than only seeing ourselves as .NET developers, it’s just as
important to also see ourselves as **software** developers.

We should recognize that we’re part of this larger cosmopolitan software
community. We have a lot to learn from this greater community. Just as
importantly, our community also has much to offer to the larger
community!

As a good friend once told me, a rising tide lifts all boats. The
interchange of ideas between these disparate technology communities can
only result in good things for everyone.

I’ve been grateful that folks such as [Nick
Quaranto](http://quaran.to/ "Nick Quaranto") have this view. Although
he’s one of those hippie Ruby folks and runs
[http://rubygems.org/](http://rubygems.org/) (which some might see as a
competitor to NuGet), he’s been extremely helpful and generous with
advice for the NuGet team. To me, that’s what community is about. Not
isolating oneself from ideas simply because they come from someone who’s
eschewed curly braces.

The good news is that I think the .NET community is actually further
along in this than it gets credit for. Podcasts such as [Herding
Code](http://herdingcode.com/ "Herding Code") have a very polyglot bent
to it. Even .NET Rocks, seen as the bastion of .NET, has expanded its
[archive](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/archives.aspx ".NET Rocks") with
topics such as node.js and Modernizr recently.

So if you identify yourself as a .NET developer, well you’re in good
company. There’s a lot of interesting .NET developers around. At the
same time, I encourage you to reach across the aisle and learn a thing
or two about a different technology. Maybe even hoist a beer with one of
those hippie rubyists or smug clojure developers!

After all, someday we’re [all going to end up as JavaScript
developers](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/07/the-principle-of-least-power.html "The Principle of Least Power")
anyways.
