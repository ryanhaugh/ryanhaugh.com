I've spent the last 3 days trying to get an installation of Windows
Server 2003 Enterprise edition onto a Virtual PC machine. I couldn't
understand why it took so long until I realized I had accidentally
selected the ISO image for the checked debug version. Arggggg!!! How
stupid is that!?

Thankfully, the normal release version is installing much faster.
