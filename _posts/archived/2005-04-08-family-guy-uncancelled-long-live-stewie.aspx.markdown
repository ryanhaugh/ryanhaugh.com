![Stewie](/images/Stewie.jpg) This is old news, but I am so glad that
the [Family Guy is "uncancelled"](http://www.fox.com/familyguy/). It
truly is of "The Simpsons" caliber of humor.

The irony of my statement is that we pretty much don't watch TV any
more. Instead I look forward to new seasons appearing on DVD (and thus
in our Netflix queue). We watched a DVD of old Family Guy episodes last
night and I nearly burst a vein from laughing. I'm a very physical
laugher.

My favorite character (shown) is the diabolical baby Stewie. He's also
the source of my favorite quote in the show so far.

> Damn you vile woman, you've impeded my work since the day I escaped
> your vile womb.
