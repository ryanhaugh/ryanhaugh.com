[Darren Neimke](http://markitup.com/) apparently is not one to shy away
from a bit of trash talk.  He IM’d me via MSN recently to warn me about
a new SUB, ready to take down [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/). In
this case, it is his newly open sourced blog engine, SingleUserBlog or
SUB, which is now [hosted on
CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=SUB).  Darren
has been on a roll lately with the recent [release of BlogML
2.0](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/06/BlogML_2.0_Released.aspx). 
Now SUB enters the scene with torpedoes blazing!

But Darren must know he is not dealing with a complete novice in
warfare.  I deftly guided him to choose the [BSD
license](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.php).  So should
they implement something I must have, I can just take it, BWAHAHA! (with
proper attribution of course, following all terms of the license and
other legal mumbo jumbo)

Darren, I believe I sunk your battleship.
