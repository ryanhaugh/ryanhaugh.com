How's this for an idea? An alarm clock that only allows setting the
alarm for the morning. No PM times allowed. I mean if you can't wake up
by noon on your own, what's wrong with you?!

If you really need to set the alarm for a PM time, the clock can provide
a special button to press while setting the alarm. But that button needs
to be guarded by barbed wire and ill-tempered sharks with lasers on
their heads. This is necessary to keep a groggy fool from accidentally
holding the button down when he's only had 4 hours of sleep.

I missed basketball this morning because my clock was set for 6:30 PM.
