Lately I have been spending a little bit of time performing maintenance
tasks on my blog’s SQL Server. I noticed that OdeToCode’s [Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/ "Scott Allen's Blog") was in
[the same
mood](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/archive/2006/02/06/2839.aspx "Care and Feeding of Community Server").

In looking to free up some database space, he took the somewhat drastic
step of deleting all referrals and urls before a certain date. Since he
doesn’t care about this data, it isn’t really all that drastic. But it
makes a data packrat like me shudder. I wanted to free up some space as
well so I created an approach that frees up a lot of space, but keeps
the data I care about.

Around 90% to 99% of my referrals are from web searches and online blog
readers. As a matter of fact, nearly all of these are from Google. Since
those referrals are not that important to me as
[WebHost4Life](http://webhost4life.com/ "WebHost4Life Hosting Company Website")
also tracks that data, I wrote a script to delete them for Subtext. Note
that the following SQL script is pretty aggressive, so use at your own
risk. You might even think of some search strings that I missed.

DELETE FROM subtext\_Referrals

WHERE UrlID IN

(

  SELECT UrlID

  FROM subtext\_URLs

  WHERE Url LIKE 'http://google.%'

    OR Url LIKE 'http://%.yahoo.%'

    OR Url LIKE 'http://yahoo.%'

    OR Url LIKE '%/Search/%'

    OR Url LIKE '%/Search?%'

    OR Url LIKE 'http://search.%'

    OR Url LIKE 'http://bloglines.%'

)

 

DELETE FROM subtext\_URLs

WHERE Url LIKE 'http://google.%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://%.yahoo.%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://yahoo.%'

  OR Url LIKE '%/Search/%'

  OR Url LIKE '%/Search?%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://search.%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://bloglines.%'

I then ran the same commands that Scott did after reading his post.

DBCC DBREINDEX(subtext\_URLs)

DBCC DBREINDEX(subtext\_Referrals)

DBCC SHRINKDATABASE(SubtextData)

In order to run those commands on .TEXT, just replace the “subtext\_”
prefix with “blog\_” and you are set.

Now I haven’t tested this, but I imagine the corresponding script for
Community Server would be the following based on its published schema.

DELETE FROM cs\_Referrals

WHERE UrlID IN

(

    SELECT UrlID FROM cs\_Urls

    WHERE Url LIKE 'http://google.%'

      OR Url LIKE 'http://%.yahoo.%'

      OR Url LIKE 'http://yahoo.%'

      OR UrlLIKE '%/Search/%'

      OR Url LIKE '%/Search?%'

      OR Url LIKE 'http://search.%'

      OR Url LIKE 'http://bloglines.%'

)

 

DELETE FROM cs\_Urls

WHERE Url LIKE 'http://google.%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://%.yahoo.%'

  OR Url LIKE 'http://yahoo.%'

  OR UrlLIKE '%/Search/%'

  OR UrlLIKE '%/Search?%'

  OR UrlLIKE 'http://search.%'

  OR UrlLIKE 'http://bloglines.%'
