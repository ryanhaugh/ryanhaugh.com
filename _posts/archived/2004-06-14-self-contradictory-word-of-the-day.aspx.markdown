Quick! What is the definition of the word **moot**? I'll use it in a
sentence.

> Upon reflection, Hezekiah realized that Ezekiel's argument was a moot
> point.

If you said something along the lines of "irrelevant", then you're
wrong. Or perhaps, right. You see, moot is one of those strange words
that can be self contradictory. Originally, moot started off as a noun.
It was a legal term for a hypothetical case argued by law students.
Sometime around the mid 16th century, it changed affiliations and became
more commonly used as an adjective.

Thus, in my example above, Hezekiah believes in his heart that Ezekiel's
argument is *worthy* of debate. However, around the 19th century, people
started to use the word to mean "of no particular significance or
relevance", which is the typical usage today. How confusing is that for
the foreigner who looks up the word in the dictionary and finds both
definitions? Context is everything. Perhaps we can submit the english
language to ECMA for standardization.
