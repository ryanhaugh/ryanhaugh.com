![Basement Gamers Video
Screenshot](http://haacked.com/images/BasementGamers.jpg) Make some time
for this one. This is an eleven minute mockumentary of two hardcore
fantasy role playing gamers. If you’ve ever rolled the icosahedron^1^
dice (or live with someone who has), you’ll find this extremely funny,
and perhaps painful.

I swear I was never this bad. Really.

if you dare.

^1^ icosahedron is 20-sided.
