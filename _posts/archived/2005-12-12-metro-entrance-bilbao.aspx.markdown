If [Joel](http://joelonsoftware.com/) can do it with FogBugz, I can try
and do it with my blog. That “it” being to post a picture of the day.

This is one of many metro entrances in Bilbao, Spain, home of the
Guggenheim Bilbao. As I stated in a previous post, Bilbao is full of
interesting design touches like these cool entrances.

Strangely enough, we never went in the metro in Bilbao because
everything we wanted to see was within walking distance or a short bus
ride.
