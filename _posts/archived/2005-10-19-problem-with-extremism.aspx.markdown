The problem with extremists is that they inevitably color the
mainstream’s perception of a thing, whether it be a race, a culture, or
a software development practice.

In truth though, it is also important for the mainstream to use better
judgement and stop falling for that trap. For example, I’ve read several
[articles](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2004/12/06.html) and blog
[posts](http://wilshipley.com/blog/2005/09/unit-testing-is-teh-suck-urr.html)
that attack unit testing (and by extension Test Driven Development) as a
practice. What is interesting is that many of the points used to pillory
unit testing are examples of taking the practice of unit testing to the
extreme, and not necessarily a reasonable and mainstream usage of the
practice.

So let’s make this very clear using a simple logical statement.

> The fact that Unit Testing is a fundamental part of Extreme
> Programming does not imply that Extreme Programming is a fundamental
> part of Unit Testing.

For example, as I said many times, code coverage is not the end goal of
unit testing. That’s extremist to say so. Your time is better spent
focusing on automating tests for the most troublesome or important code.

Automated unit tests are NOT a replacement for system testing, beta
testing, integration testing, nor any other kind of testing. Unit tests
are only one small part of the testing equation, but they are an
important part, just as all the other types of testing are important.

So in most cases, it pays to stop looking to the extremists to make a
case against a practice (such as unit testing) and start talking to
those using it in the real world and getting real results.
