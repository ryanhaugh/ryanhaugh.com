[Sir Tim Berners-Lee](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee)
starts [a blog](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/blog/4) and it’s a
veritable love fest in his [comments
section](http://dig.csail.mit.edu/breadcrumbs/node/38#comment).

And why wouldn’t it be? He did invent the [World Wide
Web](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web) after all. What would
we be doing for a living if it were’t for the web? Probably still
writing code, but still. It would be a slower costlier affair to write
code without the benefit of Googling information.

One person commented that the Web would probably have happened anyways,
but that misses the point. It may have happened anyways, but perhaps it
would have been poorly realized and we’d only now be using a 1993
version of the web (blink tag anyone?).

Remember, Leonardo Da Vince conceptualized the helicopter long before
the modern helicopter was invented, but you could hardly call him the
inventor of the helicopter. Had he been able to follow through, perhaps
we would have had helicopters before the mass produced car. Imagine
that? Our world would probably look very different. Sir Tim followed
through and we have what we have, warts and all.
