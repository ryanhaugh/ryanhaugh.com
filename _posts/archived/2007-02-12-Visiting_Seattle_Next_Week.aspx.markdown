![Seattle](http://haacked.com/images/seattle.jpg)The wife and I are
headed up to Seattle for President’s day weekend to visit some friends.

Yeah, I know. ***Why Seattle At This Time Of Year**!?*

Well with her being [all
preggers](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "It's a boy!")
and all we didn’t want to go somewhere too distant (like Tahiti). Not
only that, a little cold weather might be a nice change of pace. I mean
you can only take so many consecutive days of blue skies and sunshine.

I’ll also be swinging by the **Microsoft Campus**on Tuesday to have
lunch with my compadres [Adam
Kinney](http://adamkinney.com/ "Devigner at Work") and [Erik
Porter](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/ "Erik Porter’s Blog"). My hope
is to grovel and beg for them to sneak me through the back door of Mix
07. It probably won’t work, but I gotta give it a try, no?

I plan to show up a little earlier to see another old friend from
college who works at Microsoft and, believe it or not, **is not a
developer**! She’s in Finance doing something or other.

Hopefully I’ll run into some other Microsoftie characters I know!
