Think back to the last week or month of IM conversations you've had.
Perhaps you have archiving on and can actually read them. Now, I want
you to take a megaphone and broadcast those conversations while at the
same time emailing them to everyone in your address book. Don't forget
to print a copy for your coworkers and boss. Quick poll of hands, who's
willing to do this?

Except for you exhibitionists out there, there's probably not too many
hands in the air (you can put them down now). What not many people
realize (and for you techies, tell your non-tech friends) is that using
an IM tool is equivalent to broadcasting your conversations. Now, not
every company is listening to those conversations, but all it takes is a
widely available network sniffer and an inclination.

IM clients send messages in clear text over the network. So if big
brother feels like listening in, no problem. Some companies employ tools
for archiving IM conversations by their employees and analyzing them to
see if corporate secrets are being leaked.

If you're going to talk about sensitive topics, I'd recommend using an
IM client that encrypts communications. The [Jabber
protocol](http://www.jabber.org/) provides encrypted communications. The
client I'm using is [Pandion](http://www.pandion.be/download/)
(haacked@pandion.be).

You're employer does NOT need to know about that suspicious rash you
acquired after your business trip to Asia.
