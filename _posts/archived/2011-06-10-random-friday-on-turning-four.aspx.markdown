No, I’m not talking about my mental age.

My son turned four this past week which means I’m four years into [my
world domination
plan](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World domination plan").
One of the gifts we gave my son was a toolbox with plastic toys so we
can train him on building the mega-lasers and fortresses needed to take
over the world. Turns out that before you start dominating the world,
you have to start taking baby steps. And then toddler steps. And then
4-year old running terror steps.

In these past four years, I’ve learned a lot. For example, you can get a
four year old to believe anything. That’s come in useful as a tool for
manipulating my child to do my bidding. We were at the mall one day and
he asked about a picture of a zombie with rotting teeth and without
skipping a beat, my wife and I told him that’s what happens when you
don’t wash your face and brush your teeth. There’s still complaining
when I brush his teeth, but he’s at the sink at “two” on a three count.

Meta Bloggling
--------------

The point of this Random Friday series was to get back into the flow of
blogging. But I am concerned that my Blog will turn entirely into random
Friday blog posts. I guess it’s incentive for me to try and post some
substance once a week as well. Or turn the knob down a bit and make this
an every-other random Friday. The Fridays in between would be perfectly
ordered and predictable Fridays and not worth blogging.

Friday Appreciation
-------------------

And for the weekly thing I appreciate, it’s the sport of Soccer. Or
Football as the rest of the world calls it. It’s interesting to me how
quickly my British friends jump on me when I call it “Soccer”.

“*Bloody ‘ell! It’s called Football you stupid Amurrrrrican.*”

Which is ironic because the name Soccer comes from [Association
Football](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_football "Association Football"),
which was invented, where else? England. The term was shortened to
“Asoc” which forms the basis of the the word Soccer. In the words of
those cheesy Anti-Drug PSAs, [I learned it by watching
you](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y-Elr5K2Vuo "I learned it by watching you")!

My summer **soccer** season started this Monday and we won our first
game 5 – 4. Sadly, we went from 1st place in our division in the Winter
season to last place last spring, which means we were relegated to a
lower division for the summer season. Hopefully we can pull ourselves
back up because things are a bit chippier down here.

After each game, I’ve somehow become the chronicler of our great deeds
and I write-up a game report I send out to my teammates full of timeless
sports classics such as [Boom Goes The
Dynamite](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W45DRy7M1no "Boom goes the dynamite").
The fact that I have no future in sports writing is pretty safe. I toyed
with the idea of posting the write-ups to my blog, but I didn’t want to
turn my blog solely into a collection of Random Friday write-ups and
tales of old men playing Soccer.

I’m on vacation next week so things should be quiet for me here. Unless
past behavior is any indication in which case I’ll blog a thousand
technical posts. Thanks for reading.
