![Pen](http://haacked.com/images/FountainPen.jpg) I write this blog post
with apologies to [Dale
Carnegie](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dale_Carnegie "Dale Carnegie")
for the play on the title of his book.

Today, [Jeff Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "CodingHorror")
writes about the difference between [writing and
copywriting](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000585.html "Power, Influnce, and Copyrwriting").
His essential point is that good copyrighting is *marketing* and is
boring. Good *writing* on the other hand is engaging and *not* boring.
Understand the difference?

I think this dovetails nicely into another article I read recently at [A
List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/ "Great site for web design")
entitled [Calling All Designers: Learn to
Write!](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/learntowrite "Article on writing")

Derek Powazek points out that creating a good user experience goes
beyond rounded corners and visual design. Good writing is an essential
part of creating a great user experience. He sites
[Flickr](http://flickr.com/ "Flickr Photo Sharing") as one example of
getting it right. Rather than a button that says *Submit* they have a
button that says *Get in there*. That really is friendlier isnâ€™t it.

When you think about it, using plain casual English is much more natural
for people to read. How often in the real-world do you hear people
asking you to *submit* anything except when submitting a drug test or
tax forms in triplicate?

So I took a look at my blog and noticed that in the front end, there is
pretty much only one button that people use on a daily basis and it said
*Comment*. So I changed it to *Leave Your Mark* and sat back waiting for
the accolades to roll in on the improved user experience. Anybody hear
crickets?

Well it is going to take more than changing a single button to improve
the overall user experience here. I will actually have to start writing
well and quit using this random copy generator. But these are definitely
insights I want to take into consideration when I get around to tweaking
and updating the admin interface to
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website"). What
are areas in which we can improve the writing? How can we improve the
user experience? Little touches add up to a lot in creating a great
experience.
