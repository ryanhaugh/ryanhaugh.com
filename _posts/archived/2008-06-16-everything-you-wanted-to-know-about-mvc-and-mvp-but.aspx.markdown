Or, as my recent inbox tells me, you’re *not afraid* to ask. ;)

A coworker recently asked for some good resources on getting up to speed
on the Model View Controller (MVC) pattern. Around the same time, I
received another email talking about how people are confused around the
difference between MVC and the Model View Presenter (MVP) pattern.

better opportunity to apply the [DRY
principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don't_repeat_yourself "Don't Repeat Yourself")
by answering some of these questions with a blog post.

MVC
---

The first place to start digging into the MVC pattern is to look at the
[Wikipedia
entry](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller "Model View Controller").
That’ll get you a nice brief summary of the pattern along with a list of
resources.

> In MVC, the Model represents the information (the data) of the
> application and the business rules used to manipulate the data, the
> View corresponds to elements of the user interface such as text,
> checkbox items, and so forth, and the Controller manages details
> involving the communication to the model of user actions such as
> keystrokes and
> [mouse](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mouse_%28computing%29) movements.

If you’re really into it, you can go [directly to the
source](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/themes/mvc/mvc-index.html "MVC Index")
and read the original papers from [Trygve
Reenskaug](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/ "Trygve M. H. Reenkaug"),
the inventor of the pattern.

There you’ll learn from [the original paper
(pdf)](http://heim.ifi.uio.no/~trygver/1979/mvc-1/1979-05-MVC.pdf "Thing Model View Editor - The Original Paper")
that the initial name for the pattern was *Thing-Model-View-Editor*. The
pattern was baked via a process of extracting, improving, and
articulating existing command and control patterns used in the operation
of Norwegian ship yards in order to streamline and improve operations.

MVP
---

That ought to get you going with the MVC pattern. Now onto *Model View
Presenter*, which was a response to the inadequacies of the MVC pattern
when applied to modern component based graphical user interfaces. In
modern GUI systems, GUI components themselves handle user input such as
mouse movements and clicks, rather than some central controller.

MVP was popularized by Taligent in [this paper on the subject
(pdf)](http://www.wildcrest.com/Potel/Portfolio/mvp.pdf "MVP: Model View Presenter").
More recently, [Martin
Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/ "Martin Fowler's Site") suggested
[retiring](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html "MVP Retirement")
this pattern in favor of two variants: [Supervising
Controller](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/SupervisingPresenter.html "Supervising Controller")
and [Passive
View](http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PassiveScreen.html "Passive View Pattern").

The Difference?
---------------

So what’s the diff between MVC and MVP? Using
[WinMerge](http://winmerge.org/ "WinMerge"), here it is!

![WinMerge - [MVP.txt -
mvc.txt]](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/MVCandMVPPatternResources_71CE/WinMerge%20-%20%5BMVP.txt%20-%20mvc.txt%5D_3.png "WinMerge - [MVP.txt - mvc.txt]")

Sorry, bad joke but I couldn’t resist.

The two patterns are similar in that they both are concerned with
separating concerns and they both contain Models and Views. Many
consider the MVP pattern to simply be a variant of the MVC pattern. The
key difference is suggested by the problem that the MVP pattern sought
to solve with the MVP pattern. Who handles the user input?

With MVC, it’s always the controller’s responsibility to handle mouse
and keyboard events. With MVP, GUI components themselves initially
handle the user’s input, but delegate to the interpretation of that
input to the presenter. This has often been called “[Twisting the
Triad](http://aviadezra.blogspot.com/2007/07/twisting-mvp-triad-say-hello-to-mvpc.html "Twisting the Triad")”,
which refers to rotating the three elements of the MVC triangle and
replacing the “C” with “P” in order to get *MVP*.

What About The Web?
-------------------

If you were playing close attention, most of these articles focus on
rich client applications. Applying these patterns to the web is a very
different beast because of the stateless nature of the web.

ASP.NET WebForms, for example, attempts to emulate the rich client
development paradigm via the use of `ViewState`. This is why many
attempts to apply patterns to ASP.NET focus on the MVP pattern because
the MVP pattern is more appropriate for a rich client application with
GUI components. A while back I even tossed [my Supervising Controller
sample](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/09/ASP.NETSupervisingControllerModelViewPresenterFromSchematicToUnitTestsToCode.aspx "Supervising Controller")
into the ring. The Patterns and Practices group at Microsoft ship an
[MVP Bundle for
ASP.NET](http://www.pnpguidance.net/Tag/MVPBundle.aspx "MVP Bundle").

However, many web platforms embrace the stateless nature of the web and
forego attempting to simulate a state-full rich client development
environment. In such systems, a tweaked MVC pattern is more applicable.

> development enjoyment.

AFAIK, [Struts](http://struts.apache.org/ "Struts"), a Java web
framework, is one of the first widely used web frameworks employing the
MVC pattern, though most people now look at
[Rails](http://betterexplained.com/articles/intermediate-rails-understanding-models-views-and-controllers/ "Rails and MVC")
as being the tipping point that really brought MVC to the web and
popularized the MVC pattern for web applications.

[ASP.NET MVC](http://www.asp.net/mvc/ "ASP.NET MVC Site") is a new (in
development) alternative framework for ASP.NET developers that makes it
easy for developers to follow the MVC pattern. This framework employs
the MVC pattern rather than the MVP pattern because it does not attempt
to emulate rich client development, and thus the MVC pattern is more
appropriate.
