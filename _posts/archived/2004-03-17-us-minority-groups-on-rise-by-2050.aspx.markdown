![](/images/benetton.jpg)Being of mixed heritageI have both bases
covered. For now, I can claim my caucasian-ness and reap all the
benefits of being the dominant sub-culture. But once minorities surpass
caucasians, I can switch to

"You've oppressed us too long whitey! It's your turn!" and claim my
asian heritage.

"*Model Minority* my ass! It's *Model Majority* now punk!" I just love
playing it both ways. ;)

> be 49.9 percent of the population, the Census Bureau says.
