![RSS Bandit Logo](/images/RssBanditLogo.jpg) After much hard work by
[Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) and
[Torsten](http://www.rendelmann.info/blog/) (and a little bit of hard
work by yours truly), the Wolverine edition of RSS Bandit has been
released to the public.

If you're still using a 1.2.\* version, I think you'll really like the
extra polish and speed of this latest version.

Some highlights to note:\

-   Newspaper Styles - Compatible with FeedDemon.
-   Column Chooser - Specify the columns to display in the list view.
-   Item Deletion - A hotly demanded feature.
-   and more...

For the full release notes, [visit
here](https://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=454878).

Also be sure to check out the [updated docs](http://docs.rssbandit.org/)
for more details on these new features.

Run, don't walk, and [download it
