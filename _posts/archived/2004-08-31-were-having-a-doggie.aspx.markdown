![Italian Greyhound](/images/italianGreyhound.jpg)So after much
deliberation and research, we've decided that we're going to provide a
home for a dog. In particular, we hope to adopt an [Italian
Greyhound](http://www.dogbreedinfo.com/italiangreyhound.htm) from a
rescue center. A rescue center is basically a foster home for dogs
rescued from the dog pound. A rescue typically specializes in finding
homes for a specific breed. For example, there is a Labrador Rescue, a
Poodle Rescue, etc...

While paging through pictures and bios of dogs in need of a home, my
wife grew really sad and wanted to rescue all of them. But we have a
small Condo and can only really provide a good home to one dog.

If you're looking to adopt a pet, try checking out your local animal
shelter. For those of you in Los Angeles, check out the [LA County
Animal Care & Control](http://animalcontrol.co.la.ca.us/html/Main1.htm).
Oh, and as [Bob
Barker](http://www.cbs.com/daytime/price/about/bios/cast_bios_bbarker.shtml)
always says, "have your pets spayed or neutered".
