The ASP.NET and Silverlight team are hiring! [Brad
Abrams](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/ "Brad Abrams...") (*who happens to
be my “grand-boss” as in my boss's boss*) posted a [developers wanted
ad](http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2008/01/28/senior-developers-for-asp-net-and-silverlight-wanted.aspx "Developers for ASP.NET and Silverlight")
on his blog:

-   Are you JavaScript guru who has a passion to make Ajax easier for
    the masses?
-   Are you the resident expert in ASP.NET and consistently think about
    how data driven applications could be easier to build?
-   Are you a TDD or patterns wonk that sees how **ASP.NET MVC** is a
    game-changer?
-   Are you excited about the potential of Silverlight for business
    applications, and particularly the potential for the
    ASP.NET+Silverlight combination where we have the great .NET
    programming model on the server and client?

Some of you out there have provided great insight into how ASP.NET MVC
could be better (and then some of you just point out its warts).  Either
way, here's a chance to have an even bigger influence on its design and
code. I promise I'm easy to work with.

These are senior developer positions...

Oh, and if you do get hired and join my feature team, I like my coffee
with milk and sugar. Thank you very much. ;)
