Implied policies are policies that are never written in any employee
manual, but are implied due to real world practices or are side effects
of explicit policies. The classic example is when an employee gives
notice to an employer and the employer counter-offers with a raise. In
some cases, a raise that was refused earlier.

This was recently well illustrated by Scott Adams in the Dilbert comic
strip on May 14 (click image to see full-size)

This is probably all too common in many workplaces. I certainly have
worked at places in which the only means to receiving a raise is to
threaten to quit. At one work place, I knew of a couple coworkers who
over the years threatened to quit several times each, receiving a raise
in compensation of one form or another each time.

In most cases, this is symptomatic of a dysfunctional work environment
that is incapable of valuing employees and paying them what they are
worth.

Good managers pay attention to implied policies as much as they do the
explicit policies. This is sometimes easier said than done, as it is not
always clear what the unintended side-effects of a policy might create.
Mary Poppendieck [highlights several
examples](http://www.poppendieck.com/pdfs/Compensation.pdf "Team Compensation")
(pdf) of the unintended side-effects of common popular compensation
policies. The recent announcement to dismiss the infamous [Microsoft
Curve](http://minimsft.blogspot.com/2005/06/microsofts-30-or-how-i-learned-to-stop.html "Microsoft Curve")
is perhaps a recognition of the negative side effects of peer
competitive approaches to compensation.

Johanna Rothman [points out another implied
policy](http://www.jrothman.com/weblog/2006/03/courage-required.html "Courage Required")
when management is unwilling to budge on any of the four key constraints
of software development:

-   Resources
-   Quality
-   Scope
-   Time

If management stubbornly persists on asking for all features (scope)
without willing to budge on time, resources, or quality. Then managment
is making an implicit decision. As Johanna states (and I reword), **not
making a decision is an implicit decision**. By not deciding on which
features to prioritize, management is effectively delegating strategic
decisions concerning which projects to staff and which to postpone.

Once you start taking a hard look at your workplace, you can probably
come up with a laundry list of implicit policies. What are some of the
ones youâ€™ve experienced?
