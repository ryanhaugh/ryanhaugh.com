Charlez Petzold makes [the following
lament](http://www.charlespetzold.com/blog/2007/04/270433.html "Petzold Book Blog")
in response to [Jeff Atwood’s
review](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000846.html "Atwood's Review of WPF Books")
of two WPF books, one being Petzold’s.

With all due respect to Mr. Petzold, and he certainly deserves much
respect, I think the comparison to PowerPoint is unfair and really
misses the point.

**Since when is technical writing prose?**

Well it often does meet one of the [definitions of
prose](http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/prose "Definition of Prose").

> ​1. the ordinary form of spoken or written language, without metrical
> structure, as distinguished from poetry or verse.\
> **2. matter-of-fact, commonplace, or dull expression, quality,
> discourse, etc.**

Using that definition, I fail to see how the death of dull and
commonplace expression signals a loss for the future of written
communication. If anything, it’s a step in the right direction.

Technical writing is supposed to teach and help readers learn and retain
information. Having visual aids not only helps cement the information in
your mind, but also aids in finding that information when you need to
look it up again.

**Long passages of unbroken prose are great for getting lost in mental
imagery when reading a novel, but it sucks for recall**. Prose is alive
and well in its proper place. Save the lengthy prose for the next great
work of fiction, but cater to how the brain works when writing something
meant to be absorbed, learned, and remembered.

I think the Head First series really gets it when it comes to how the
mind works and learns. From the introduction to [Head First Design
Patterns](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007124?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0596007124 "Head First Design Patterns on Amazon").

In a subsequent section, the book describes the Head First learning
principles, a couple of which I quote below. I highly recommend reading
this entire intro the next time you are in the bookstore.

What we see here is that studies after studies show that appropriate use
of images and graphics improve recall. Not only that, but a casual tone,
like that found in a blog, also helps recall.

Unfortunately, Petzold draws an unfair analogy between [Adam Nathan’s
WPF
book](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0672328917/youvebeenhaac-20 "Windows Presentation Foundation Unleashed on Amazon")
and PowerPoint. We’ve all heard [that PowerPoint is
evil](http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.09/ppt2.html "PowerPoint"),
but the evil is in how users misuse PowerPoint, not PowerPoint itself.
PowerPoint certainly makes it easy to go to the extreme with noisy
graphics resulting in garish crowded presentations.

It’s this proliferation of PowerPoint presentations that favor graphics
to the detriment of the content that leads to the disdain towards
PowerPoint. But it is also possible to create sublime presentations with
PowerPoint with just the right amount of graphics.

Even Tufte would acknowledge that getting rid of graphics and bullet
points completely is also extreme in the opposite direction and works
against the real goal, to convey information in a manner that the
audience can understand and retain it.

Drawing a comparison between Nathan’s book and PowerPoint suggests that
the Nathan’s Book is all fluff and flash. But based on reading sample
chapters, that is hardly the case. As Jeff wrote, the graphics, colors,
and bullets all are used judiciously and appropriately. This isn’t the
case of Las Vegas trying to pretend it is Florence. There’s real
substance here.
