Found this [interesting post](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/2004/03/23/locking)
via [Eric Gunnerson's blog](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericgu/archive/2004/03/24/95743.aspx) 
(PM for the C# compliler team) blog.

```csharp
using (TimedLock.Lock(obj)) {
  // Do stuf within the lock
}
```

It's an interesting approach to get a lock statement with a time out. It
would be nice to perhaps add a timeout syntax to the lock statement in
C#. Maybe it would look like this:

```csharp
object obj = new object();
int milliseconds = 10000;
try
{
    lock(obj, milliseconds)
    {
    	//Do something with obj
    }
}
catch(LockTimeOutException exception)
{
  //Handle exception
}
```

One thought I had, and let me know if I'm off base, but it seems we
could add debug code to Ian Griffith's `TimedLock` class to "register"
locks on an object. This would only happen if you conditionally compiled
with `#DEBUG`, but the idea is that when a class gets a `TimedLock` on an
object, `TimedLock` would add information (such as the call stack and
thread id) to a hashtable with the object as a key. Thus, if another
class attempts to get a lock on the object and times out, the exception
could have information about who had a lock on the object. May be useful
for debugging deadlock situations.

UPDATE: I implemented the stack traces retrieval. Check out my [TimedLock repository](https://github.com/Haacked/TimedLock/) for the code and history of this class.
