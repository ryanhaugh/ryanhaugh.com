[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") asks
the question, [Is Open Source a Crap
Idea](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/IsOpenSourceACrapIdea.aspx "Is Open Source A Crap Idea").
I sure hope not.

One thing to consider is that the type of open source projects that we
are involved with are very niche market and hobby oriented. I have a
feeling that the Subversion project will continue to do well because
they make a product that is essential for many businesses.

[CollabNet](http://www.collab.net/ "CollabNet") for example sees the
value of the open source model and of Subversion as a source control
tool so much so that they provide full time employees to work on it. I
doubt we’ll see that happen with [RSS
Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org "RssBandit Home") or
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Site") any time
soon (though I welcome any company who wish to become sponsors).

The sad truth is that most open source projects I’ve seen are pretty
much pushed forward by the efforts of one or two ultra committed people.
I think the important thing for these projects to look at is a
succession model for who will push the project forward when they burn
out or move on. Or they need to really focus on marketing to bring in
more developers.

I don’t have the answers to this one. I personally started Subtext
because I wanted to tweak .TEXT to my liking and I thought it would be a
great forum to try out new coding techniques and new technologies.
Lately though, I found that I enjoy the product management and team lead
aspect of running Subtext as much as I do the coding aspect. In that
respect, I see a long shelf life for me on this project.

I doubt I would stop working on Subtext unless I just plain stopped
blogging. Despite building a great distributed team, we are all busy and
checkin activity is steady but not very active (though our mailing list
is involved in some great discussions). I have tempered my expectations
for what I can accomplish and realize that even if I was the only one
plodding away at Subtext, it’s a fun and relaxing hobby with an outcome
that I personally benefit from.
