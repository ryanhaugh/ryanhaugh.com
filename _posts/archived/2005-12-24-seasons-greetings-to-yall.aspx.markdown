My parents are downstairs watching basktetball, my brother will arrive
here tonight around 8PM, I’m wrapping a gift for my wife, and my coffee
downstairs is getting cold.

But still, I wanted to wish you my loyal readers (and determined Google
searchers) a very Merry Christmas, or a Happy Hannukah (or is it spelled
Channukah these days?), or a happy Kwanza, or Yuletide cheer, or a
belated Happy Solstice. If you don’t celebrate anything this time of
year, and I really don’t blame you, then just be happy that the terrible
Christmas music will soon end and we can prepare for the real fun
holiday, New Years!

Anyways, I hope you are all doing well.
