![Code Complete 2](/images/CodeComplete2.jpg)*Code Complete* by Steve
McConnell was the first programming book that had me glued to its pages
as one would read a page turner thrilling novel. I couldn't put it down.
I still have several scars from the many obstacles I would walk into as
I read the book and attempted to carry on my normal business. It's that
good!

Simply, Code Complete is the Bible of code construction, i.e. the craft
of writing code. Now on the horizon, [Code Complete
2](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/0735619670/104-4151528-6682347?%5Fencoding=UTF8&coliid=I27SDK7I7JJZR0&colid=2NR9ZWS6ESIXJ "Code Complete 2")
is on pre-sale at Amazon. I can't wait to get my hands on this.
