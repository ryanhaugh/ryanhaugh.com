Gizmodo had a piece on an [armored
iPod](http://www.gizmodo.com/gadgets/armor/index.php#armored-ipod-122617)
yesterday which was made by someone in Japan. My wife helped me
translate the original site and send a tip to
[Gizmodo](http://www.gizmodo.com/). So the “Phil” in the little thanks
section is me. Of course I was hoping for a link. ;)
