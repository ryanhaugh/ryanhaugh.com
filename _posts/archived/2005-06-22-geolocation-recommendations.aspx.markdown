![Geolocation](http://haacked.com/images/geolocation.jpg) Anybody out
there use a geolocation service they are happy with?

In case youâ€™re unfamiliar with the term (and thus unlikely to be able to
answer my question), Geolocation is the process of converting an IP
Address into a geographic location. I think many services simply provide
a database of ip address to geographic locations.

Also, how do these services handle AOL? Would every AOL user appear to
be coming in from Virginia? Thanks if you have any insight!
