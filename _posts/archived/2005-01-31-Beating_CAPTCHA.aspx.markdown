![CAPTCHA](/images/captcha2.jpg)As if to punctuate my post entitled
*[Image Based CAPTCHA is Fast Losing itâ€™s
Appeal](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/20/1967.aspx)*, [Casey
outlines his .NET
code](http://www.brains-n-brawn.com/default.aspx?vDir=aicaptcha) used to
beat the CAPTCHA employed by many blogs using a Neural Network approach.

![Neuron](/images/neuron.jpg) This is a beautiful attack on CAPTCHA (as
it is currently often implemented) and only shows that there is no "ONE"
solution to rule them all. The attacks against rel="nofollow" as
ineffective against spam now apply to CAPTCHA. Blocking automated spam
in all its forms will be a continuous iterated process encapsulating
multiple combined defenses (such as rel="nofollow").

And to the haters that are pissed that Casey published this, get over
yourself. You need to realize that his post shows that CAPTCHA (as it is
currently implemented) is a wall of sand. If it was this easy for him to
beat CAPTCHA, a black hat out there probably already has a similar
solution. Ignorance is no substitute for security. Now you know it can
be beat quite easily, go fix it and quit whining.

Thanks to [Scott

for pointing out Casey's approach.
