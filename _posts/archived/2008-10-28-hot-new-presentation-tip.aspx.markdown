Before giving a presentation, I review [Scott Hanselman’s top 11
presentation
tips](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/11TopTipsForASuccessfulTechnicalPresentation.aspx "Presentation Tips").
Well I have a twelfth tip that Scott needs to add to his list, and he’ll
vouch for this.

![rockband](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/HotNewPresentationTip_9F48/rockband_3.jpg "rockband")
A couple of hours before Jeff and I gave the ASP.NET MVC presentation
([the video is now
posted!](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "Video of my talk")), we
played some [RockBand](http://www.rockband.com/ "RockBand") in the Big
Room (exhibition area).

Playing [Eye of the
Tiger](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHWS0H2JqSU "Eye of the Tiger")
before a big talk has a great way of both pumping you up and loosening
you up at the same time. When I ran into Scott and told him this tip, he
said he did the very same thing, playing Eye of the Tiger on RockBand
before his talk. In his case, I think he played for two hours.

In any case, I felt like my talk went well. Jeff was entertaining as
always and provided that taste of real-world relevance to what we’re
doing with ASP.NET MVC. I particularly liked it when he remoted into his
live server and showed the audience how his 8 CPU server was doing via
task manager.

In any case, if you watched my talk, be sure to **[submit
evals](http://is.gd/57Yv "Submit Evals of ASP.NET MVC talk at PDC")
(higher number means better. Whomever gave me all 1s, that’s just mean!
;)**. I look forward to hearing your feedback. I’d love to be able to
show people that there’s a demand for this type of framework and
development model (transparency, source releases, etc…) and maybe we can
get more than one MVC talk next time. I think it’s time I do a really
advanced one. :)
