So the missus and I are heading over to Puerto Vallarta this Sunday for
a short mini-vacation. For me it is a chance to recover from Mix06. It
was kind of unfortunate that the two events are so close together, but
that was pure coincidence.

We are staying at a nice small bed and breakfast and looking forward to
exploring the local area, lounging on the beach, and generally enjoying
an itinerary and agenda free few days. I am not bringing a computer so I
will be totally disconnected, which will be a nice feeling.

I think.

I do get a bit panicky without my blogs after a few ~~days~~~~hours~~
minutes, but the missus promises me I will be ok.
