Well my wife and I arrived back from Spain tonight after a grueling
series of flights. Is it just me or has this heightened security
environment we live in today given airport staff a crutch to be
completely rude and uncommitted to decent service? Is it not possible
for security and service to go together hand in hand? It is certainly
something we strive for as software developers.

Complaining and bitching aside, we had a great trip and Iâ€™ll be sure to
bore you with some more detailed stories and photos later. Posting
vacation photos on a blog is the modern equivalent of those old three
hour slideshows your parents used to bore your neighbors with after a
long vacation.

One nice surprise is that while I was gone, my ad-sense earnings were
higher than average. Perhaps I should take more vacations.
