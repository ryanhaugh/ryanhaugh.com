you’ve read my blog for any length of time, you know I tend to go on and
on about the virtues of blogging and participating in Open Source
projects.

You might even start to suspect that I think we could end wars, poverty,
and hunger and sit around singing *Cumbaya* together in harmony if only
everyone would blog and participate in Open Source.

Really now. I’m not that naïve. I’m sure we could pick a better song to
sing around the campfire.

All kidding aside, **I really have put my money where my mouth is.**

the past, I’ve talked about the [challenges of
hiring](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/12/16/Hiring_Is_Challenging.aspx "Hiring is Challenging"),
as well as my belief that [blogs are a great means to connect with good
developers](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/04/Better_Recruiting_Through_Blogistry.aspx "Better Recruiting Through Blogistry").

That’s how I met and hired [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") who is a
tremendous technical leader, developer, and business partner.

I also think that judging [potential hires on open source
contributions](http://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch08_Actions_Not_Words.php "Open Source Contributions As a Recruitment Tool")
(as [37Signals](http://37Signals.com/ "37Signals software company")
suggests) is a great way to find good developers, though I’m not so
inclined to be as extreme as they are and only hire Open Source
developers.

But rather than just talking about hiring Open Source developers, we
recently hired [Steve
Harman](http://stevenharman.net/ "Steve Harman’s Blog"). Steve was a
Java developer at a large financial institution when he started
contributing to [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext") so that
he could cut his teeth with C\# and .NET.

Over time, he really took on a lot of responsibility and impressed me
with both his good judgment, and his work ethic. By actually working
with him on a project and seeing the quality of his code, I got a really
good sense of him as a developer and potential coworker that is
**impossible to get from a three hour or even three week interview**.

I’ve been responsible for hiring as a development manager at three
companies, with varying degrees of success. It turns out, that my best
hiring has been at [VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT").

Hiring is full of landmines. I’ve hired people who were great in
interviews, but ended up not being able to code their way out of a Hello
World program.

That is why I’m such a firm believer in the power of blogs and open
source contributions to filter out the true gems among the lumps of
coal.

Of course, another great way to hire good people, though draws upon a
smaller pool of talent, is to **hire the best people you’ve worked with
in the past**. A while back we hired Pat Gannon who is a fantastic
software developer. The only reason he doesn’t get mentioned much here
is because he doesn’t have a blog, and you know how I feel about blogs.

Maybe if we didn’t we keep him so busy building systems, he’d have time
to write a blog post or two.
