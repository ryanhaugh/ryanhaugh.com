It appears that one Islamic extremist has issued a [Fatwa against
playing
soccer](http://www.iht.com/articles/2005/10/16/opinion/edporter.php) by
the regular rules. Here are some choice examples.

> ​4. Do not follow the heretics, the Jews, the Christians and
> especially evil America regarding the number of players. Do not play
> with 11 people. Instead, add to this number or decrease it.
>
> ​5. Play in your regular clothes or pajamas or something like that,
> but not colored shorts and numbered T-shirts, because shorts and
> T-shirts are not Muslim clothing. Rather they are heretical and
> Western clothing, so beware of imitating their fashion
>
> ​8. Do not play in two halves. Rather play in one half or three halves
> in order to completely differentiate yourselves from the heretics, the
> polytheists, the corrupted and the disobedient.

Thanks to [Walt](spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/) for sending this to
me.

I should note that this is edict was issued by an extremist and is not
representative of general Islamic scholarship and thought. I am still
waiting for the Christian set of soccer rules. They might look something
like...

> ​1. A woman shall not be allowed to referee as it sayeth in the Bible,
> 1 Timothy 2:12 *“I do not permit a woman to teach or to have authority
> over a man”.* If a woman attempteth to have authority and become a
> judge, her name and character shall be impugned and criticism by other
> Christians appeareth in every newspaper.
>
> ​2. Whence the ball shall enter the goal, the goal shall be postponed
> till the scorer recite a verse from memory chosen at random by the
> referee. Afterwards, to celebrate, the team shall be allowed to pray,
> but not cheer.
>
> ​3. Players shall not lust after scoring a goal for lust is sinful.
> Only through prayer and should the good lord will it, shall a goal be
> allowed. One who scores a goal shall not say “I scored a goal” but
> merely say, “The Lord Jesus Scored a Goal and I was merely his
> vessel.”
