I'm trying out this sweet plug-in for the Windows version of iTunes.
After installing this plug-in, you can click on the musical notes at the
bottom of w.Bloggar and it will insert information about the currently
playing song wherever your cursor is located. This [page
lists](http://www.cowpimp.com/archives/2004/06/02/blogging-plugins/)
plugins for Winamp versions 2,3, and 5 as well as iTunes (the one I'm
using).

Now you'll all get to experience (from time to time) my awesome music
collection. ;)
