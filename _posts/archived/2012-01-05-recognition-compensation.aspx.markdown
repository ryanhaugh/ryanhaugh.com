Mary Poppendieck writes the following in [Unjust Deserts
(pdf)](http://www.poppendieck.com/pdfs/Compensation.pdf "Poppendieck paper on compensation"),
a paper on compensation systems (emphasis mine),

Written over seven years ago, the paper is just as insightful and
applicable today. For example, let’s apply it to the recent dust-up
about the legitimacy and fairness of the [Microsoft MVP
Program](http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/ "Microsoft MVP Program").

I think the MVP program means well. It’s not trying to be a conspiracy
or filch you of your just desserts. But if you think about the MVP
program as a compensation system, it becomes very clear why people feel
disillisioned.

What compensation am I talking about?

1.  An MSDN Subscription
2.  Privileged access to product teams and not yet public information
    (under NDA)
3.  A yearly summit which provides hotel rooms and access to product
    team members as well as a nice party.

Not only is it a compensation system, but the means by which
compensation is doled out is perceived to be arbitrary and hidden. It’s
a recipe for mistrust.

Intrinsic Motivations
---------------------

Someone asked me what I thought about the MVP program recently and I
said I think Microsoft’s actually a great company, but I don’t think you
should seek out recognition from Microsoft or any other corporation for
your community contributions. I think that provides the wrong incentives
to build community.

If you run an open source project, don’t do it to receive recognition
from Microsoft. Or any other corporation for that matter (except maybe
you’re own). Do it to scratch an itch! Do it because it’s fun. Do it to
show cool stuff to your peers. Worry about their recognition more than
some corporation.

If you answer questions about a technology on StackOverflow, do it
because you enjoy sharing your knowledge with others (and you want the
SO points!), not because it’s on a checklist to receive an MVP award.

Just as Mary points out, when you start to frame these activities as
means to receive an extrinsic reward, you become disillusioned. So
whether the program exists or not, we should strive on our part to not
feel a sense of entitlement to the program and focus on our intrinsic
motivations.

Fixing It
---------

I covered what I think we should strive for. But what do I think
Microsoft should do? Several things.

So far, I glossed over the the fact that recognition from Microsoft
isn’t the only reason people want the award. There are material
benefits. MVPs are part of a privileged group that gets early access to
what Microsoft is doing, which might provide a real competitive
advantage. Why wouldn’t you seek that out?

### Open Development

Let’s tackle the first thing first, privileged “early access”. Well
there’s one easy solution to that. Do you know why
[NuGet](http://nuget.org/ "NuGet") doesn’t have an “early access”
program? Drew Miller [nails it on
Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/anglicangeek/status/154972618167033856 "Drew tweet"):

> Know how you avoid the need for a privileged group of folks under NDA
> that inevitably is seen as special and superior? Develop in the open.

NuGet sidesteps the whole question of a recognition program by
developing in the open. The same is true for [the Azure
SDK](https://github.com/blog/1010-azure-on-github "Azure SDK"). When
active development occurs in a public repository, the whole concept of
“early access program” makes no sense.

Not only that, but recognition in an open source project doesn’t come
from some corporation. It comes from the maintainers of a project and
from the folks in the project’s community that you’ve helped. You can
point to the reason people are recognizing you.

### Better Free Tools

The other reason folks want an MVP is to have access to the professional
tools. Most companies will easily shell out the money for this, but if
you’re a hobbyist or open source developer, it’s a lot of money to shell
out.

In this regard, I think Microsoft should either make its free Express
tools have more pro features such as allowing Visual Studio Extensions
and multi-project support, or simply make Visual Studio Professional
free, and focus on developing the ecosystem that gets a boost when
everyone has better tools to build on your platform. Everyone wins.

### Focused recognition

I don’t think it’s inherently wrong for a company to recognize people’s
contributions. But it has to be done in a way so that it’s seen as icing
and not an entitlement or cronyism.

It’s darn near impossible to conceive of a recognition program that
would be seen as universally fair and recognizes something so broad as
“community contributions”. A better approach might be to have multiple
smaller recognition programs. Focus on removing obstacles that get in
the way of people inherently doing the things that’s good for all of us.
For example, it benefits Microsoft’s when:

1.  People are helping solve each other problems on the forums.
2.  People are giving talks about their products.
3.  People are building software (open and not) on their platforms.
4.  Probably some others I’m forgetting…

For what it’s worth, I think \#1 is already solved by
[StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow"). Just move
your forums there and be done with it. After all, nobody gets upset when
they answer a question on Twitter and don’t get StackOverflow points.

Recognize!
----------

Will Microsoft change the program? I have no idea. I’m not really all
that concerned about it really. In the meanwhile, **we** can recognize
folks who make our lives better. We don’t need to wait for Microsoft to
do so. I’ve used a huge swath of open source projects that have made my
development smoother. I’ve found many great answers in forums, blog
posts, StackOverflow that unblocked me.

Moving forward, I’ll make an extra effort to thank the people
responsible for those things. Maybe there’s some projects and folks you
should recognize. Go for it! It’ll feel good.
