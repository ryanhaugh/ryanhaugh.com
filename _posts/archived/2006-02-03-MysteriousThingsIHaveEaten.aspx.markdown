I love this [post by Steve

(found via [Raymond

concerning the mysterious things he as eaten. It just goes to show you
that us asian (and half-asian) brothers can eat some seriously weird
crap.

I have never tried Sea Cucumber (that I know of) nor Kudu Doo-Doo, but I
have had everything else on his list. Here is my own list of mysterious
things I have eaten.

### 1. Fermented Soy Bean (aka Natto)

My wife introduced me to this foul smelling Japanese dish. At first I
wondered why she was eating the garbage when I first took a whiff, but I
realized that others have said the same thing to me when I would bring
Kimchee to school back in the day.

So I told myself I would try and acquire the taste since I was curious
why she liked it so much. It has worked, as I now love it.

### 2. Raw Chicken

For this dish, I have my wife’s brother to thank. Again this is a gift
from the Japanese. Apparently there are several places known for serving
raw chicken. I suppose if I was to take the risk of eating raw chicken
anywhere, it would be Japan. They are well known for their cleanliness
and care in crafting food.

It tasted a lot like tuna sashimi (maguro) and was quiet delicious.

### 3. Blowfish (Fugu)

I guess Japanese food in general is mysterious to me. I [wrote about
this experience here](/archive/2005/01/09/1838.aspx "Blowfish").

### 4. Uni (Raw Sea Urchin)

The first time I had this I nearly gagged. But I have since learned that
the first one I tried was not of the highest quality. When a master
sushi chef prepares Uni, it is smooth like butter.

### 5. Chicken Feet

This one is often served at a Dim Sum restaurant. My Chinese friends
might not find this so mysterious, but I sure do. I am not a big fan,
and I’ve given it a couple of chances.

I am sure my wife will remind me of even more mysterious things I have
eaten. What are yours?
