![Congo Map](/images/Congo.jpg)Apparently I’m not the [only
one](http://weblogs.asp.net/rosherove/archive/2004/06/02/146362.aspx "Congo Spam")
who’s been contacted by the son of the late Democratic Republic of Congo
President Laurent Desire Kabila. I’ve also been contacted by several
other members of royalty or political dissidents who are fleeing the
Congo.

Each of these people need MY help in transferring insane amounts of
money. I’m talking barrels and barrels of cashola. Apparently, nearly
everyone I know has been contacted by someone from the Congo wishing to
transfer money. Congo must be a very very rich country. These guys are
smuggling enough cash to make Bill Gates look homeless.
