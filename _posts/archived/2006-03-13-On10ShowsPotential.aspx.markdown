So a little while ago I [mentioned a new
site](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/06/BeyondChannel9.aspx "On10")
named [On10](http://on10.net/ "On10"). I didn’t know what it was at the
time, but I was assured by
[Erik](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/ "Erik Porter Blog") and
[Adam](http://www.adamkinney.com/ "Adam Kinney") that it would be cool.

And then it was released and I have to admit, I was not blown away. In
truth, I was a bit confused. It looked to me like Channel 9, but
highlighting the use of Microsoft technology outside of Microsoft.

But this [channel 9
video](http://channel9.msdn.com/showpost.aspx?postid=171265 "On10 Video")
sheds some light on the site and I am impressed. Not so much with what
the site is itself, that may take time to grow on me, but what is going
on under the hood.

Some interesting points:

-   First of all, their site validates as XHTML Transitional. Good job
    guys, as the Mix06 site did not validate.
-   Judicious use of AJAX to provide a rich experience.
-   The site works fine with a rich experience in Safari, IE, and
    Firefox.
-   You can add comments next to a video while the video continues
    playing.
-   Hackable URLs. Ex...
    [http://on10.net/people/haacked/](http://on10.net/people/haacked/ "Haacked Profile")
-   Trackbacks are treated as first class comments. So they are free
    with their traffic. I hope their spam filter is strong.
-   XBox Live integration via you can select your XBox Live avatar as
    your On10 avatar.

All in all, On10 is an “enthusiast” site that looks to participate in
and give back to the community.
