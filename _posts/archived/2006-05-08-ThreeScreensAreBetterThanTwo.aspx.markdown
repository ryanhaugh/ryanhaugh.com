Since I had a rough week last week, I thought I would post something fun
today. While [some
people](http://scottonwriting.net/sowblog/posts/6104.aspx "Scott on Writing")
are just jumping on the dual-monitor bandwagon, I have recently moved on
to three screens.

![Three Screens](http://haacked.com/images/threescreens.jpg)

Of course that is not exactly true. The two screens on the right are
attached to my new Dell Dimension 9150 workstation. The one on the left
is attached to my old Shuttle system. That there is running the VMWare
Server that hosts Subtext’s CruiseControl.NET build server.

The only reason I got the third screen is that because of a deal they
were offering, it actually lowered the cost of the lease to get this
screen than to not get it. You can’t beat a deal like that!

Rather than using a KVM, I am using MaxiVista to remote control the
computer via the third monitor. That works pretty nicely, though
MaxiVista seems to hiccup alot.
