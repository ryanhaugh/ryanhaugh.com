I’m happy to announce the release of NuGet 1.2. It took us a bit longer
than we expected to get this release out there, and I’ll explain why
later, but for now, go install it!

**Upgrade!**If you go into Visual Studio and select Tools | Extension
Manager, click on the Update tab and you’ll see that this new version of
NuGet should be available as an update. It only takes a minute and it
really is that easy to upgrade.

For more details about what’s in this release, check out [the
announcement on
nuget.org](http://nuget.org/announcements/nuget-1.2-released "NuGet 1.2 Released").

There’s also a new version of NuGet.exe corresponding with this release
as well as the Package Explorer. If you have a fairly recent version of
NuGet.exe, you can upgrade it by simply running the following command:

`NuGet.exe u`

Thanks to everyone who helped make this happen. I’ll be writing about
our plans for 1.3 fairly soon.
