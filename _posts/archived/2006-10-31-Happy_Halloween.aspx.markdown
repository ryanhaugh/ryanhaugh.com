I love Halloween because it makes for great parties. What makes a party
great? Costumes! This past weekend I drove up from Los Angeles to San
Jose to stay with my friend Kyle and his wife Cara. That evening we
drove up to San Francisco to attend a house party in a large four story
house in the hills. It was about the perfect size for the 100+ people in
attendance, and they hade a few top-notch local DJs spinning.

Unfortunately, I didn’t bring my camera so I had to rely on “donated
pics”. I usually am a total shutterfly. Of course, not having my camera
gave me more time to enjoy the party. Click on a pic for a larger
version.

My buddy Kyle went as [Noam
Chomsky](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noam_chomsky "Noam Chomsky on Wikipedia"),
which was a hit of a costume, as simple as it was. It’s rather freaky to
see a black and white 2-D face on a normal body. The face looked almost
disembodied. The first pic with [Hunter S.
Thompson](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunter_Thompson "Hunter S. Thompson on Wikipedia")
just cracks me up. What a literary powerhouse! I went as the thoroughly
unimaginative “Kung-Fu guy”. The necklace I’m wearing is made up of
miniature skulls of my enemies. Yes, I fight those crazy
[Lilliputians](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gulliver’s_Travels "Gulliver’s Travels on Wikipedia.").

The DEA agent was probably one of my favorite costumes, just for the
chill he sent down the spine of some partygoers.

As expected, someone with showed up in a Crocodile Hunter costume,
though I don’t understand the red wig. We also had Cartman and his
favorite snack in attendance.

Finally, the governator showed up, but he was inappropriately dressed. I
had to black out that portion of his costume. Let’s just say, it took a
pretty big circle to black that portion out. Good going Guv’nor!

The beaker costume above was one of my favorites.  She and her boyfriend
both were beakers. Apparently the sight of them making out was
disturbing.  That’s my friend Jason aka *Count Pimpula* on the right
with his girl Rocel.
