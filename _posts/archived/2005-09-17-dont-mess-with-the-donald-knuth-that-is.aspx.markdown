Mathematicians and Computer Scientists know that the Donald that has had
real impact in our world is Donald Knuth, not Mr. Trump. He is a giant
in the industry and very well respected.

Heâ€™s also tireless and persistent. Consider this, he has been working on
his seminal work, *The Art of Computer Programming* for 43 years and he
figures he has 20 more years of work left. Volume 2 of the work,
*Seminumerical Algorithms*, formed much of the backbone for my college
thesis on pseudorandom number generation.

So it is with great amusement that I [read his
letter](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=76608c5d-f71a-440e-be87-165fa8b6f2f0)
to the w3c flaming them for depracating certain html elements and
attributes. Good find [Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/)!
