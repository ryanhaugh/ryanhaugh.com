Just upgraded my blog to the latest version of Subtext in the Subversion
1.9 branch, not that you needed to know that. I just appreciate you
letting me know if you run into problems leaving a comment and such by
using my [Contact
page](http://haacked.com/contact.aspx "Contact Me page").

Before I release 1.9.2 (long story why that's ends with a 2 and not 1),
I need to update the Contact page so that spam filters also apply to the
contact page.
