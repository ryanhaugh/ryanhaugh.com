So I spend my time writing up a hopefully useful guide to Subversion on
SourceForge and all this one reader from Spain (¡hola!) wants to know is
where I got my theme from?

Well let me tell you amigo. Step one is to install the uxtheme
multi-patcher. I first learned about this patcher via [this post by Ryan
Farley](http://ryanfarley.com/blog/archive/2006/01/11/14992.aspx?Pending=true "Pimping a Desktop").
This effectively replaces the uxtheme.dll that comes with Windows with
one that allows you to use other custom styles.

You can find information about the patch from
[here](http://themes.belchfire.net/index.php?showtopic=8767 "Neowin.net uxtheme patch")
or directly download it from [this
link](http://www.llbbl.com/data/nw_uxpatcher.zip "UXTheme patch").

I was a bit hesitant to install this as I generally don’t like to mess
around with system dlls, but [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway's Blog") and
others have told me they have not run into any problems. So if you have
any problems, blame Jon.

Once you have the patch installed, you can download interesting themes
from
[DeviantArt](http://www.deviantart.com/ "A site full of windows customizations").
The particular theme I chose is called [VXP
Final](http://www.deviantart.com/deviation/23231403/ "VXP Final Theme").

My first impression was that it was a bit cartoony. But after spending a
bit of time with it, I noticed that this skin was much more original and
well thought out than many of the others I’ve seen. The maker of this
theme paid a lot of attention to little details, including interesting
rollovers of the start menu icon etc...
