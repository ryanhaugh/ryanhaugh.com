So [Adam Kinney](http://adamkinney.com/blog/ "AdamKinney.com") isn’t
quite as [ga-ga over
Oblivion](http://adamkinney.com/blog/130/default.aspx "Oblivion, a fitting title")
as I. Understandable. As he points out, it is missing the key ingredient
of social interaction with other real humans.

Now why would you want to interact with other humans when you have the
computer? ;) I suppose it is true that conversation via a drop down list
isn’t doesn’t produce quite as stimulating a conversation. What if the
AI reaches the point that a game like Oblivion is indistinguishable from
an online multi-player game? Would that be as satisfying?

I digress. As Adam states,

Well that’s because no amount of HDR lighting, Anti-aliasing, large
texture maps is going to match the lighting effects and graphics going
on in your noggin.

I admit, I was into the paper and dice game back in the day. I lived in
Guam at the time and kept it on D-L for very self-conscious reasons. The
funny part is that my friends, all in different circles (Hawaiian
volleyball player, skateboarder, heavy metal dude, African American
dude, etc...) didn’t know there was any stigma (imagined or real) to the
game. I would cringe when they would tell our friends we were heading to
so and so’s house to play Dungeons and Dragons.

But again, I digress...

[My company](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT") regularly hosts internal
conference calls via Skype. It got me thinking one day that Skype would
be a wonderful means to play paper and dice Role Playing Games. The
difficulty in getting a game together after highschool was not only the
lack of time, but also the sparseness of interested parties. There is no
way you are going to get six people to drive across town to meet all on
the same day and time.

With Skype, geographical location is no longer a limitation. Granted you
still lose some of the benefits of physical presence such as passing the
Doritos and knocking over your friend’s figurine when he accidentally
hits you with his fireball. But at least you have a much larger pool of
people to choose from to start a game. Is anyone doing this?
