![Evolution of Development](/images/evolution.jpg)[Jet
Brains](http://www.jetbrains.com/) released a [free
upgrade](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/download/whatsnew.html) to
their ReSharper product. Let me tell you, using this product feels like
walking on land after a long stint trying to walk under water.

Recently, I was trying to write some code on a coworker's computer and
kept hitting funky key combinations that had no meaning on his machine
since he didn't have this installed. I had to actually type out a bunch
of code that just spills out when using this add-in. It felt so stone
age.

Just to be complete, I know many are fans of [CodeRush for Visual
Studio](http://www.devexpress.com/Products/NET/CodeRush/). I liked it
enough, but the lack of Refactoring support was a problem for me, which
is why I chose ReSharper.
