![Toshiba M200](http://haacked.com/images/m200.jpg) I’m pretty bummed
today as my Tablet PC went on a holiday and refuses to come back. I’m
pretty sure it’s a problem with the hard drive as the last event viewer
message I saw was a warning that the system detected an imminent hard
drive failure. That’s when I started backing everything up.

Hey there buddy, thanks for the heads up, but if you see it coming,
can’t you do something about it?

The worse part is that I am getting the warranty runaround and I am not
yet sure who is at fault. Toshiba is telling me that my warranty was
only good for 90 days because it’s a factory reconditioned system. Well
that’s odd because the warranty pamphlet that came with it says that I
have a year warranty. Specifically it says...

> One (1) Year Limited Warranty ENCORE Notebook Computers
>
> For ENCORE (Remanafactured) Notebook Computers Purchased within the
> Fifty (50) United States and District of Columbia.

If that weren’t enough, the sticker on the back of the computer says the
following:

> This Toshiba Computer Product has been reconditioned, and although not
> new, is warranted by Toshiba America Information Systems, Inc. under
> its standard Limited Warranty, excluding any coverage for external
> blemishes.

Now let’s see, I bought the computer in Californ-eye-aye, which
qualifies as being a member of the Fifty United States. A Tablet PC is a
notebook. And it is remanafactured. Now I wonder what leads me to
believe I am still covered?

The nice lady in a far off country on the phone for Toshiba told me that
some remanafactured PCs come with one year and others come with three
months. She says I?m in the three months camp. She says resellers such
as Tiger Direct (her example, not mine) sometimes tell customers what
they want to hear, and not the truth about the warranty. I wonder if
she’s blowing smoke up my rear (an impressive trick) or if indeed, the
retailer pulled a fast one on me.

So tomorrow I need to call PC Video Online to find out their version of
the warranty story. Worst case scenario, I’ll purchase a new and even
better hard drive. Either way, this sucks.

UPDATE: I called PC Video Online and they told me that they are indeed
an authorized Toshiba reseller and that they don’ open the boxes they
receive from Toshiba. Therefore, they have no responsibility for the
warranty materials packaged within.

As Walter (a brilliant lawyer I might add) pointed out in my comments,
it does appear that I am entitled to a one year warranty. From [various
reports](http://www.tabletpcbuzz.com/forum/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=25443)
around the web and my comments, it seems that hard drive failures in the
M200 is quite common. At this point, I don’t necessarily want the same
old hard-drive anymore. I just want Toshiba to honor its commitments.
