Saw a post on the RSS Bandit newsgroup about
[AmphetaRate](http://amphetarate.sourceforge.net/), a recommendation
engine for blogs.

Having worked on a recommendation and personalization engine on a large
music community site (now owned by a company with a name you would
exclaim if you were to find a huge stash of gold), I think the idea of a
blogging recommendation server is compelling and if done right, very
useful for finding new and interesting content.

The basic premise is this, you subscribe to a Recommendations feed from
the recommendation server. Then, by rating blog items via your RSS
Aggregator, the recommendations get personalized to your tastes.
Currently, only one aggregator supports this service (RSSOwl).

I wonder if others will think this is worthwhile to implement in RSS
Bandit.
