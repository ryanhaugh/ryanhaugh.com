Tonight we had our first game of the new season against Hollywood United
who now feature [Alexi
Lalas](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexi_Lalas "Alexi on Wikipedia")
and [Frank Le
Boeuf](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/03/24/PlayingAgainstAWorldCupWinner.aspx "Former Chelsea player"),
among several other former pro and national team players.  Let’s just
say the result wasn’t pretty.  At least not pretty for us as they
dismantled us 12 to 0.

As bad a beating as it was, it was exciting to be playing against such a
high caliber team.  And we managed to put together some good plays, but
pretty much looked erratic and rushed with the ball.

I asked one of my teammate’s wife to take some photos, but being a night
game, none of them turned out too well.  Here is the best I got showing
both these players.

I had one good play in which I dummied the ball, faking Alexi and taking
him out of the play as he was hot on my back (I know, I’m reaching
here).  Of course later in the game, he embarrassed me with a nutmeg.

After the game we were chatting with a player from their team who is
going to be in a new TV show called *Heros*.  He told us his superpower
in the show was that if he touches you he paralyzes you.  Now we know
what happened on the field.

Next game we hope to hold them to single digits.  We’re in need of a
keeper if you know any former standout keepers.
