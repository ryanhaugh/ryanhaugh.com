BoingBoing has this story on a guy who fixes computers in exchange
for...er...*special favors* from female customers. First the plumber,
and now the computer guy. This could start a whole new breed of dirty
movies.

It’s a damn good thing I know how to fix computers around here. Now I
just need to learn how to do the plumbing.

The last thing I want to see are the ads that would be associated with
