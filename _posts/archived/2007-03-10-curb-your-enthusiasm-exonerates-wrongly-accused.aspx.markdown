Catalan must be feeling “Pretty good. Pretty, pretty, pretty, pretty,
good.” His poor luck seemed to exceed Larry Davidian proportions when he
was accused of murder. But his luck took a turn for the better after
over five months in Jail.

Catalan claimed to be at a Dodgers game with his daughter when the
murder occurred. His defense attorney scoured TV footage of crowd shots
from the game but could not find Juan. After learning that the show
*[Curb Your
Enthusiasm](http://www.hbo.com/larrydavid/ "Curb Your Enthusiasm")*,
starring Larry David who co-created *Seinfeld*, had taken footage at the
ballpark that day (I think I remember this episode!), HBO allowed the
attorney to search through their footage and he found a time-stamped
shot of Catalan in the outtakes.

I read this in the Los Angeles Times yesterday morning and laughed at
his good fortune to be saved by a television show.

I bet he is. The full [Los Angeles Times article is
