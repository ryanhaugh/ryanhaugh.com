Today my wife and I celebrate our fifth anniversary of being legally
married. If you’ve read my blog long enough, you might have seen [this
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/06/14/two-years-ago.aspx "Wedding Anniversary")
which suggests we were married June 14, not September 12.

It’s all pretty simple, you see. We had our wedding ceremony on June 14
2003, but were secretly legally married on September 12, 2002.

Ok perhaps the term *secret* *marriage* is a bit too strong. But it
sounds cool, doesn’t it? The story is that at the time, my wife wanted
to take a long trip back to Japan before our planned wedding.
Unfortunately, with the tightening up of immigration following September
11, we were concerned she’d have trouble coming back. So we got legally
married at the Beverly Hills Courthouse to make sure she could return.

Recently we decided to follow the DRY principle (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
and only really celebrate our legal anniversary, as it keeps it simple
for me.

Hard enough for a guy to remember one anniversary much less two!

So to Akumi (yes, she actually reads my blog), Happy Anniversary. I love
you very much! And I was going to post that other silly pic of you we
found, but I want to live to see the next five years of our life
together.
