Fox Sports World is undertaking strategic initiatives regarding the
branding, on-air look, and marketing of the channels. As a soccer fan
(and a friend of an FSW exec) I've been invited to participate in a
focus group to evaluate their projects tonight. My main suggestion will
be start a new channel devoted to soccer. FSS (Fox Sports Soccer).

UPDATE: Well my main suggestion was unnecessary. Fox is planning to
change "Fox Sports World" to "Fox Soccer Channel". We evaluated some
logos and slogans and talked about the identity of Fox Sports World.
Received some nice swag too including a pen that lights up like a blue
glowstick. Great for taking notes at your next rave.
