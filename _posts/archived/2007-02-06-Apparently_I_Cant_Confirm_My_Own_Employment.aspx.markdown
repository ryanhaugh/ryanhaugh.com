I received a call from a nice lady asking to speak to someone who could
confirm an employment at [VelocIT](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT").

Me: *Sure, I can do that.*

Lady: *What’s your name and title?*

Me: *I’m Phil Haack, the CTO.*

Lady: *Is there someone else I can speak with?*

Me: *Uhhh, why? Is there a problem? I am an owner and manager of the
company. Certainly I have authority to confirm an employment.*

Lady: *I can’t have you confirm your own employment.*

Me: *Oh! This is for me!?*

Man, I’d be in big trouble if I were a one-man shop.
