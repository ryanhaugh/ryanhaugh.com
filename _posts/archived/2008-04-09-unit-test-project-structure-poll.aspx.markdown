When I build applications, I personally like to have my unit tests in a
separate class library project than the application I am testing.
[That’s just how I
roll](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/10/Structuring_Unit_Test_Code.aspx "Structuring Unit Test Code").

I just assumed this is how everyone structures their unit tests, but
I’ve talked with some people who have a deep history in TDD who put
their code in the same project.

So I wanted to create a simple poll to find out how people are
*actually* structuring their unit tests. I’ve been involved in various
internal discussions looking at how Microsoft design, tools, code can
better support unit testing across the board.

Note that this is not an opinion question. I don’t think one way is
“more right” than another. I just want to make sure we have an accurate
view of what the real practice is out there.

So please do answer this poll and encourage others to do so. I’d hate
for internal teams to make choices based on a wrong assumption. Thanks!
