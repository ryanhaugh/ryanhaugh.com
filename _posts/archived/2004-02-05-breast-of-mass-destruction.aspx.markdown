It’s amazing the fallout over the Janet Jackson breast incident.

My god people! It’s a breast!

It was on for three seconds!

We’ve all suckled on one when we were children (some even later) so I
don’t buy the concern “think about the children!” Children see a breast
on tv they think, “Hee Hee, a booby.” They don't think, “Oh! I saw a
breast. My innocence has been stolen, I think I’ll go out and engage in
promiscuous unprotected sex.” Show a kid the closeup they’ll probably
think, “Oh! That’s gotta hurt!”

In any case, I think [Chris
Sells](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/ "Sellsbrothers.com") makes a good
point here:
