Update Corrected my pop-culture iconography mix up.

Thomas Eyde brings up a great point in the comments section of [Scott
Hanselman's
post](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommentView.aspx?guid=734532ba-55ad-4a7b-85ae-05cf5cf27b05#commentstart "Death of NDoc")
about SandCastle and the death of NDoc.

Open Source project that are lacking in developer support probably need
to tear off a page from the corporate playbook and be a bit more savvy
about recruiting developers. I often hear developers wistfully day
dreaming that if they just open source their pet project, legions of
developers will take up the banner and join in.

Ha! Hardly! **Recruitment is necessary and fundamental to an OS
project.** So much so that SourceForge has a tab dedicated to the topic
in the admin section of a project.

Sourceforge also provides a [*Help Wanted*
page](http://sourceforge.net/people/createjob.php?group_id=137896 "Help Wanted")
to recruit volunteers for a project. There is also a discussion forum
[dedicated to
recruitment](http://sourceforge.net/forum/forum.php?forum_id=710 "Talk About Recruitment").

But by no means limit yourself to SourceForge. Consider putting a free
ad in [CraigsList](http://craigslist.org/ "Craigâ€™s List") or in the
forums of other developer communities.

The second comment on Scott's post by Martin Bennedik questions the
donation model.

When I wrote my original challenge to donate to Open Source projects, I
wanted to avoid a

~~Suzanne Summers~~ Sally Struthers *For just five dollars you can feed
the kids of those poor Open Source Developers* plea. As Scott points
out, monetary contributions are far down on the totem pole of
contributions. For the subtext project, I added a [Contribution
page](http://subtextproject.com/Home/About/Contribute/tabid/153/Default.aspx "Contribution")
that discusses several ways in which developers contribute should they
feel the desire.

I think it is the project leader's job to make the barrier to
contribution as low as possible.
