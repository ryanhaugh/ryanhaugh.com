If you’re in the Reykjavik area on November 7th, come join me for a
beer-up. A Beer-Up is basically a meet-up, but with lots of beer!

-   **When:** November 7th, 2011 at 8:00 PM
-   **Where:** [The English
    Pub](http://enskibarinn.is/index.php?option=com_frontpage&Itemid=1)
    (*yes, I went all the way to Iceland for an English pub*)
-   **Why:** To talk about ASP.NET, ASP.NET MVC, NuGet, Software
    Development whatever geeky topics you want. And if we do our jobs
    right, by the end of the night we’ll discuss life, philosophy, and
    which direction is my hotel?

I’ll be stopping overnight in Reykjavik on my way to [Oredev
2011](http://oredev.org/2011 "Oredev 2011 Conference"). I’m pretty
excited as I’ve always been fascinated by the natural beauty of such a
geologically active place. I definitely plan to see the [Blue Lagoon
geothermal spa](http://www.bluelagoon.com/ "Blue Lagoon") (pictured
above) during my stay.

If you’re in the area and love to talk about coding, technology,
whatever, do join us!
