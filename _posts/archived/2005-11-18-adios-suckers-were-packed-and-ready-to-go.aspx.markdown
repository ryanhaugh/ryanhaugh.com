![Map of Spain](http://haacked.com/images/MapSpain.jpg) The missus and I
are pretty much packed and ready to go. We have to be at the airport at
5 AM. Yes, that is *AM* as in early morning (or late at night depending
how you look at it).

I doubt we’ll get much real solid sleep, so I probably won’t even try
too hard. Besides, I am at that point before any trip where my mind is
racing trying to figure out that one thing I forgot to pack. And there
is always that one thing. As I step on the pain, it will suddenly spring
forth into consciousness and I will curse myself for forgetting it.
Whatever it may be.

Also, I am NOT bringing my computer. I am detaching from this here
intarweb (though I will bring my iPod). So this blog will go radio
silent for nine days unless we have spare time and happen to be in an
internet cafe. I might login to delete comment spam.

*P.S. While I’m gone, be sure to read some of my latest posts and let me
know what you think.*
