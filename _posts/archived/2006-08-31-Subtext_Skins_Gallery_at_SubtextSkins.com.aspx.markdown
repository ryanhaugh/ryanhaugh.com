As a follow-up to the recent release of Subtext 1.9, I would also like
to introduce a little something I put together at
[http://subtextskins.com/](http://subtextskins.com/ "Subtext Skin Gallery").

Since we have yet to incorporate a skin preview or gallery in Subtext, I
setup a site that features each of the [default
skins](http://subtextskins.com/Home/DefaultSkins/tabid/155/Default.aspx "Default Skins"). 
Additionaly, the site also has a [Skin
Showcase](http://subtextskins.com/Home/SkinShowcase/tabid/156/Default.aspx)
where users can submit skins to share with the community.  User
submissions are moderated.

Although we plan to overhaul skinning in the next version, it is still
worthwhile to share skins here as my hope is to help port any user
submitted skin (unless it gets too ridiculous in there).

I started off the sharing with the Marvin 3 Column skin which used to be
included with Subtext.  **If you have a skin you wish to share, please
do share!**  I recommend that your zip file include a
[Skins.User.config](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/26/Developing_Custom_Skins.aspx "Developing Custom Skins")
file rather than a Skins.config file.
