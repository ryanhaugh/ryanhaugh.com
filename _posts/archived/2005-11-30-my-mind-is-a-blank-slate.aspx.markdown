Apparently I am quite sensitive to jet lag. My wife has been cheerful,
upbeat, and energetic, while I’ve come very close to biting the heads of
little babies and throwing my own feces on the wall. Yeah, it’s that
bad.

In this dazed catatonic state, I’ve found my mind to be a blank slate.
Not the good kind of blank slate which implies a fresh start. No, I am
talking about that dreary empty slate that means I am bereft of ideas.
Tap on my head and you hear an endless echoing inside.

The end result is that I am suffering (and “suffering” is not too strong
a word my friend) from Bloggers Block. My friend
[Jon](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/) tells me he has five unfinished
posts and notes for at least 50. I checked my notes and I have about
zilch ideas waiting in the wings.

The best way to beat writer’s block is to write. Anything. So there you
have it. I am making you, the reader, suffer through this mindless
drivel, so I can remove a block. Interesting content will follow in the
future. One hopes.
