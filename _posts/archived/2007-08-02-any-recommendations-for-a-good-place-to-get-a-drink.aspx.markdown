I mentioned I’ll be at the [Microsoft campus next
week](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/30/at-the-microsoft-campus-next-week-and-other-engagements.aspx "At the Microsoft Campus").
Scott Koon (aka
[LazyCoder](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/ "LazyCoder Blog")) pinged
me about meeting up for a drinky drink and geeky geek conversation and
Sunday works best for him.

Anyone have a good recommendation for a place to get a good drink in or
near Redmond? Perhaps BillG’s hidden stash on campus? **Anybody want to
join us**? I think 10 or 10:30 PM works for me.

It’s standard procedure for me to roll into the morning session of a
conference completely sleep deprived and trashed from the previous
night’s celebrations. It just wouldn’t be right to not continue that
tradition.

I’m also free Monday night as far as I know.
