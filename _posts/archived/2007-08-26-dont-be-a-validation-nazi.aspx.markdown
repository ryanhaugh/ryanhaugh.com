In my [last
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/08/21/i-knew-how-to-validate-an-email-address-until-i.aspx "I Knew How To Validate an Email Address Until I Read The RFC"),
I wrote about how most email validation routines are too strict when
compared against what is allowed by the RFC. Initially I dismissed this
phenomena as the result of ignorance of the RFC or inability to
understand it, as I had trouble understanding it myself.

However, I think there’s something more fundamental at work here when it
comes to validating user data. It seems that many developers, myself
included, choose to ignore [Postel’s
Law](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robustness_Principle "Robustness Principle on Wikipedia") when
it comes to field validation. Postel’s law states...

> Be conservative in what you do; be liberal in what you accept from
> others.

Postel wrote that in an RFC that defined TCP, but it applies much more
broadly. It’s natural that developers, used to the exacting nature of
writing code for a compiler, where even the most minor of typos can
bring a program screeching to a halt, have a tendency to apply such
exactitude on their users.

Dare I say it, but developers can tend to be validation nazis.

This is a mistake. Users are not compilers so we need to cut them some
slack.

[A List
Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/ "A List Apart - A site on web design, usability, and accessibility")
provides some great examples of mistakes in treating users like
computers and ways to correct them in the article, [Sensible Forms: A
Form Usability
Checklist](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/sensibleforms/ "A List apart article on form usability").
Here’s a snippet about dealing with phone numbers (emphasis mine).

The recommendation they give fits with Postel’s law by being liberal in
what they accept from the user. The computer is really really good at
text processing and cleaning up such data, so why not leverage that fast
computation, rather than throwing a minor annoyance at your users. No
matter how small the annoyance, every little mental annoyance begins to
add up. [As Jacob Nielsen
writes](http://www.useit.com/alertbox/annoyances.html "Does User Annoyance Matter?")
(emphasis his)...

**However, in the case of the email validation, the problem is much
worse.** It violates the golden rule of field validation (*I’m not sure
if there is a golden rule already, but there is now*)...

> **Never ever reject user input when it truly is valid.**

In the comments of my last post, several users lamented the fact that
they can’t use a clever GMail hack for their email address because most
sites (mine included at the time, though I’ve since fixed it) reject the
email.

For fun, I wrote a crazy regular expression to attempt to validate an
email address correctly according to the RFC, but in the end, this was a
case of [Regex abuse, not Regex
use](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000214.html "Regex use vs. Regex abuse"). But
as one commenter pointed out...

> THE ONLY WAY TO VALIDATE AN EMAIL ADDRESS IS TO DELIVER A MESSAGE TO
> IT!

This served to drive home the point that attempting to strictly validate
an email address on the client is pointless. The type of validation you
do should really depend on the importance of that email address.

For example, when leaving a comment on my form, entering an email
address is optional. It’s never displayed, but it allows me to contact
you directly if I have a personal response and it also causes your
Gravatar to be displayed if you have one. For something like this, I
stick with a really really simple email address validation purely for
the purpose of avoiding typos...

> `^.+?@.+$`

However, for a site that requires registration (such as a banking site),
having the correct email address to reach the user is critical. In that
case it might make sense to have the user enter the email twice (to help
avoid typos, though most users simply copy and paste so the efficacy of
this is questionable) and then follow up with a verification email.

In the end, developers need to loosen up and let users be somewhat
liberal about what they enter in a form. It takes more code to clean
that up, but that code only needs to be written once, as compared to the
many many users who have to suffer through stringent form requirements.
