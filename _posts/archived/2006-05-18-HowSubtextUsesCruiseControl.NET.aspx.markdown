Not too long ago [I mentioned
that](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/03/SubtextCruisingInCruiseControl.NET.aspx "Subtext CruiseControl.NET")
the Subtext team is using
[CruiseControl.NET](http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/ "CruiseControl.NET Home")
for continuous integration. Well [Simone
Chiaretta](http://blogs.ugidotnet.org/piyo/ "FoxyBlog (in italian)"),
the developer who set this up, [wrote up an article describing
Continuous
Integration](http://www.subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Developer/ContinuousIntegration/tabid/145/Default.aspx "Continuous Integration and Subtext")
and the various utilities that Subtext uses in its CI process.

As you can see in the screenshot, the last build succeeded. Check out
this small snippet from our [NCover
report](http://haacked.dyndns.org/ccnet/server/local/project/SubText/build/log20060518054054Lbuild.1.4.1.69.xml/NCoverBuildReport.aspx "NCover report")

As you can see, we have a bit of work to do. But remember, [code
coverage isnâ€™t
everything](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/11/03/CodeCoverageIsNotEnough.aspx "Code Coverage Isn't Enough").
