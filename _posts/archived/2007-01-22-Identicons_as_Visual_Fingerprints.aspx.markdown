How do you uniquely identify a person, without divulging the identity of
that person?**For example, given a set of personal artifacts, how would
I arrange the set of artifacts grouped by the person to which they
belonged?

The answer is quite easy, isn’t it (especially given the title of this
blog post and the image to the right)? You can look at the fingerprints
on the items.

Unless you happened to have a file that mapped the fingerprints to
individuals, you won’t know who the comb and mirror belong to, for
example, only that they do belong to the same person and not to the
person who owns the scissors.

**The analogous structure in the world of information theory and
computer science is the digital fingerprint, often created via
a**[**hash
function**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash Functions on Wikipedia").
MD5 and SHA1 are two of the most commonly used hash functions.

A hash function is a one way algorithm for converting data into a number
which for the most part can be used to identify the data without
revealing the data. This is why it is common to hash passwords before
storing them in a database.

In order to authenticate a user, I don’t need to know the user’s
password, I just need to know that the hash I’ve stored corresponds to
the password you typed.

[Don
Park](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/ "Daily Habit, blog of Don Park")
recently invented a system for representing IP Addresses without
divulging the actual IP Address via a system of glyphs, which he calls
[Identicons](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/2007/01/19/identicon-explained "Identicon Explained").
This serves as a nice means of identifying commenters on a blog, without
divulging their actual IP address, which could be a privacy concern. The
following image are some examples of identicons.

What’s interesting to me about identicons is that they have wider uses
beyond representing IP addresses. As Don states,

**One way to look at identicons is that they are a visual representation
of a hash value.** They sort of add even more weight to the fingerprint
analogy by being visual like a real fingerprint.

For example, for security reasons, many free software providers provide
an MD5 checksum of their software binaries. You can see an example of
this from the [PuTTY download
page](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html "PuTTY Download Page").

[![Putty Download Page. Shows links to MD5
Checksums](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/IdenticonsasVisualFingerprints_CB0/image0_thumb5.png)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/IdenticonsasVisualFingerprints_CB0/image07.png) 

The next screenshot shows some actual hash values of exes.

[![Hash

Looking at the first listing, we can see that for *pageant.exe*, the
hash value is *01d89c3cbf5a9fd2606ba5fe3b59a982*, kind of a mouthful,
right? Another way that could be represented is via an Identicon, which
would be more readily recognizable.

Of course, in this situation, the security minded person would use an
automated MD5 checksum checker rather than manually confirming the
binary. But do you trust your md5 checksum checker? A quick visual
confirmation would be a nice additional vote of confidence in this
scenario.

If you’re interested in playing with Identicons in .NET, I recommend
taking a look at [this .NET
port](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000774.html "Identicons for .NET")
of Don Park’s implementation written by [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff Atwood’s blog, Coding Horro")
and [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway’s Blog").

I had the pleasure of reviewing the code with Jeff and he’s quite proud
of his caching optimization. Rather than caching the `Bitmap` object, he
caches the PNG output as a `MemoryStream` instance. That ends up saving
a ton of memory.
