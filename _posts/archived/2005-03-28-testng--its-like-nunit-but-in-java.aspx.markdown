Good ideas get coopted. That's what they do. For example,
[JUnit](http://junit.sourceforge.net/) was coopted by the .NET community
and ported into NUnit. However in [NUnit 2.0](http://www.nunit.org/),
the .NET community innovated with the usage of attributes.

Now Java has caught up with
[TestNG](http://www-106.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-testng/)
(thanks to Kyle for pointing me to this). With the brand spanking new
version of Java out there (JDK 5.0 aka Tiger), Java now has Annotations.
This is pretty much equivalent to Attributes in .NET. TestNG takes
advantage of Annotations and builds a unit testing framework around them
that looks quite familiar if you regularly use NUnit 2.\*.

And I'm certain both these platforms have borrowed ideas from even older
platforms.
