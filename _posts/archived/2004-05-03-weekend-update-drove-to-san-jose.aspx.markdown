![Rock The Vote](/images/RockTheVote.jpg)This weekend I drove up to San
Jose to hang out with [Mr.
Oba](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net "Kyle Oba") and his woman
Cara. You can't toss a rock there without breaking a window of some
high-tech company (whoops! Sorry E-Bay). Driving to his apartment, I
passed Canon, Hitachi, E-Bay, Bea, Sun, etc....

This was my first time at their apartment which is in a really nice,
clean, new building. We took the dog (named "Dubya" for a walk). He was
much better behaved than his namesake.

Later that night, Kyle and I drove up to San Francisco and on the way
passed a slew of companies with names starting with "Net" or "Inter".
Talk about some uncreative names that violate the principle of
timelessness. Sun at least does a decent job with naming. "Sun", it'll
be a few billion years before that name is out-dated.

![San Francisco At Night](/images/SanFran.jpg) Our target in SF was 1015
Fulsom to see Paul Van Dyk spin. Promoters are a funny lot. They bill
the event as a "Rock The Vote" benefit where a whole 1 DOLLAR! of the
ticket price is donated. So how much do they charge for pre-sale
tickets? \$31.00 of course (where normally this would be a \$30 event).
They're really giving back to the community. At least we bought
pre-sales: the door cost was \$50.

When PVD spins, he always has his trusty IBook (or is it a G5) macintosh
handy. I got close enough to see the warm glow of the white apple on the
translucent white background while he queued up an album on the decks.

Nonetheless, we had a great time despite the huge crowd and heat. After
partying like rock stars till 5AM, we drove back to San Jose to crash.
