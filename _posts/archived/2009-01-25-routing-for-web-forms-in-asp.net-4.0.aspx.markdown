A while back on a lark, I posted a prototype demonstrating how one could
use [Routing within Web
Forms](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/03/11/using-routing-with-webforms.aspx "Routing for Web Forms").
This is something you can do today with ASP.NET 3.5 SP1, because of the
work we did to separate Routing from ASP.NET MVC. I would have liked to
include Web Form Routing as part of the Routing feature when we were
working on SP1, but we didn’t have the time to do so in a robust manner
before SP1 was locked down.

Since then, [Scott
Galloway](http://mostlylucid.net/ "Scott Galloway's Blog"), who just
happens to be my office mate, has taken the reigns and is the PM in
change of guiding the Web Form Routing feature to be included in ASP.NET
4.0 in a more integrated fashion.

He wrote a blog post earlier today describing some of the ways that
[routing will be more deeply integrated into
ASP.NET](http://mostlylucid.net/archive/2009/01/25/asp.net-4.0-webform-routing-quick-rsquon-dirty-version.aspx "ASP.NET and Routing")
such as new properties of the Page class, cool uses of Expression
Builders, etc… That’s just a teaser as he promises to go a little more
in depth soon.
