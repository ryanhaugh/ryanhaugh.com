Last month, I wrote about some frustrations I had with [Microsoft
Money](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/17/FrustratedWithMicrosoftMoney.aspx "Article on frustrations with Microsoft Money").
I am pleased to report that everything has been resolved and I want to
take the time to thank members of the Microsoft Money team.

It turns out that the Microsoft Money group is more accessible than I
thought. It is unfortunate that the Microsoft website doesn’t highlight
this more, but there is an active community that participates in the
microsoft.public.money newsgroup. One customer also maintains a
[FAQ](http://umpmfaq.info/ "Microsoft Money FAQ").

It turned out that the password character length in Microsoft’s records
varied with those given by the bank a while ago. Russ on the Money team
was able to confirm this and a patch was out in a matter of days. The
final trick to getting it to work was I needed to refresh the online
service setup. I was given the following instructions.

1.  Open Money.
2.  Select Account List.
3.  Select the financial institution you want to re-brand in the Account
    List.
4.  Under Common Tasks click Connect to bank and click the institution's
    services link.
5.  Select For Financial Institution Name under View contact
    information.
6.  Select Update advanced Web settings on the left navigation bar.
7.  Hold down ctrl + shift and then click Restore Defaults.
8.  Click OK and then click Done.
9.  Select the New online services are now available link.
10. Select the Update Services link to the left of your financial
    institution name.
11. Continue through the rest of the Update Services screens.

So now Money is happily integrated with my online broker. Money rules!

P.S. I probably shouldn’t have made that crack about switching back to
Quicken. Word on the street (and [in my
comments](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/17/FrustratedWithMicrosoftMoney.aspx#feedback))
is that Intuit engages in some underhanded practices with their software
and that Money is much better than Quicken. I can’t corroborate the
underhanded practices, but I did switch to Money from Quicken many years
ago and haven’t regretted it.
