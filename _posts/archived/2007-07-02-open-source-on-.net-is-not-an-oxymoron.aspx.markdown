I have a confession.

I am an Open Source developer and my platform of choice is the .NET
framework by Microsoft. Not only that, I actually believe it is a good
thing to [support Open Source
projects](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html "Supporting Open Source Projects in the Microsoft Ecosystem")
in the Microsoft ecosystem.

Yeah, really. In response to this tidbit, I have heard and am bracing to
hear replies such as...

> Why would you do that (support Open Source on Microsoft)?

Or

> It can’t be Open Source if it’s on the Microsoft platform.

One rationale given is that ***it ain’t really Open Source unless the
entire stack is Open Source***. I call this the *all or nothing* view of
Open Source.

[![the-stack](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/OpenSourceOn.NETIsNotAnOxymoron_12D9B/the-stack_thumb.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/OpenSourceOn.NETIsNotAnOxymoron_12D9B/the-stack.jpg "The Stack")

For example, one popular stack is the
[LAMP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29 "Wikipedia on LAMP (software bundle)")
stack. That typically stands for *Linux*, *Apache*, *MySql*, and *PHP*,
each of which are Open Source systems.

Interestingly enough though, the stack appears to end with the software
layer. For example, proprietary hardware running the LAMP stack does not
invalidate the *Open Sourceness* of the stack.

In contrast, I have the *vacation view* of Open Source. While I would
love to be on vacation all the time, I’m pragmatic and I’ll take as much
as I can get. Some vacation is better than no vacation.

### Think About The Developers

Besides, why should PHP scripters have all the fun? There are legions of
developers gainfully and productively employed writing software using
.NET. Why shouldn’t they get to experience some of the benefits of using
Open Source software?

So what if their stack is proprietary. Is it so wrong that these
developers are more productive because of tools like
[Log4Net](http://logging.apache.org/log4net/ "Log4Net")? Don’t they
deserve a bit of Open Source spice in their lives?

### But You Lose Out On Freedom!

There are as many flavors of Open Source as there are “developers!” in a
Ballmer speech. But what they all share in common is some level of
Freedom. In general, the freedom to view and change the code.

The only difference is really in the level of freedom and how that
freedom should apply. I [wrote before in my guide to Open Source
Licensing](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/DevelopersGuideToOpenSourceSoftwareLicensing.aspx "Developer’s Guide to Open Source Software Licensing")
that with some licenses such as the GPL, the freedom of access to the
code is paramount. Any code that makes use of the GPL must itself be
Open Source and licensed in a compatible fashion as the GPL.

Whereas with licenses such as the new BSD or MIT license, the freedom of
the user of the code is paramount. There are pretty much no restrictions
to using the code, even within proprietary systems.

Despite these philosophical differences, most reasonable people agree
that they both constitute subsets of Open Source software.

### I Have Freedom Where I Most Need It

The stack that I use with
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project") might be
called *WISC *which consists of *Windows*, *IIS*, *SQL Server*, and
*C\#*. It sounds like a board game that Elmer Fudd might play on the
weekends. Pretty much every layer of that stack is proprietary software.
This is where the *vacation view* comes into play.

On this stack, I’ll never be able to view the Windows source and
recompile it with a bug fix. But in truth, I’ll probably never have the
need (nor capability) to do so. Often, the part I do need to change on a
day to day basis is much higher up the stack. It’s the stuff that more
directly applies to my business needs. It’s software like
[Lucene.NET](http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/ "Lucene.NET") that
I’m more likely going to tweak and build [a business on top of
it](http://koders.com/).

This isn’t to say I wouldn’t mind being able to view the source for
Windows, but it’s a balancing act. On the one hand, I like Open Source
software. On the other hand, I like to feed my family by being
productively employed and the Microsoft platform is great for being
employed. Sure there are plenty of PHP and Ruby jobs, but I honestly
really like writing C\# code and the tools available to do so.

### Only A Moron Thinks It’s An OxyMoron

In the end, I hold firmly to the belief that .NET is a viable platform
for Open Source software. It might not meet everyone’s expectations for
what Open Source is *supposed* to be, but it’s a good thing to many
people and it is here to stay.

If you don’t believe me, just look at the list of projects mentioned in
the comments to [this CodingHorror
post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000894.html#comments "Supporting Open Source Projects").
You’ll see that Open Source in the Microsoft Ecosystem is more than just
viable, it’s thriving and deserves to be recognized.
