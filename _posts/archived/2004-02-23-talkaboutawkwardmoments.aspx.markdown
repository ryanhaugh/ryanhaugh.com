This is probably the funniest thing I’ve ever heard happening on a
train:

> Yesterday my mom and I went on a train ride that is often billed as
> being a way for couples to spend a special occassion. The train was
> full of couples celebrating anniversaries, birthdays and other special
> occassions. Quite a number of couples were making out openly at the
> end of the train ride whose main features are a picturesque dinner on
> the train and a stop with a tour of a local winery.
>
> One of the less romantic aspects of this train ride is that for the
> most part you have to share a table with another couple facing them.
> this means they get to overhear your conversation and interrupt yours.
> The couple we shared our table with were celebrating the guy’s
> birthday and his girlfriend was treating him to a special day out
> that ended with the train ride. After we got back on the train from
> the winery tour the unexpected happened. They were engaged in
> conversation and he was comparing her favorably to ex-girlfriends,
> then all of a sudden he got down on one knee and pulled out a box with
> a ring in it. After a stunned silence she took it, said some words
> softly then said “I appreciate the sentiment but the timing is
> inappropriate” and handed it back. This was followed by her voicing
> her concerns about his ability to support them and him rattling of how
> much he made a month plus various bonuses, etc. I think it went
> downhill from there.
>
> All through this I was staring out the window trying to make small
> talk with my mom but failing miserably. If and whenever I do end up
> proposing to someone I’ve definitely learned a thing or two about what
> not to do.
