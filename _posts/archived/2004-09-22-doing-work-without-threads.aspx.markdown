A while ago I wrote up a [post on Asynchronous
Sockets](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/06/882.aspx).
[Ian](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/) was kind enough to send me
an email correcting a few [niggles with
it](http://haacked.com/archive/0001/01/01/895.aspx) and in an email
exchange, cleared up a few other misconceptions about how sockets (and
other IO operations for that matter) really work.

Well now he posts a great article that points out that a program doesn't
always use a thread to perform some work.

This is recommended reading.
