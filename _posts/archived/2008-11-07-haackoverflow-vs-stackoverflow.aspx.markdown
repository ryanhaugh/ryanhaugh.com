During my talk at the PDC, I heeded [Hanselman’s call to
action](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/CommunityCallToActionNOTNorthwind.aspx "No More Northwind")
and decided to veer away from the Northwind “Permademo” and build
something different.

In the middle of the talk, I unveiled that I was going to build a
competitor to [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/ "StackOverflow")
which I would call HaackOverflow. This was all news to
[Jeff](http://codinghorror.com/ "Jeff Atwood") as he hadn’t seen the
demo until that point.

The demo walked through some basics of building a standards based
ASP.NET MVC application, and sprinkled in a bit of AJAX. At the very
end, I swapped out the `site.css` file and added an image and changed
the site from the drab default blue template to something that looked
similar in spirit to StackOverflow.

If you haven’t seen the talk yet, you can [watch it on
Channel9](http://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC21/ "ASP.NET MVC Talk at PDC").
Also, the links to my slides and the source code are also available on
that page.

I only mention it now because Jeff recently Twittered a link to the
[Reddit Remix of the StackOverflow
logo](http://www.redditall.com/2008/11/we-pay-joel-and-jeff-visit-on-stack.html "Reddit Visits Stack Overflow"),
which reminded of my own hack job on their logo.
