![Rainbow](http://haacked.com/images/Rainbow.jpg) [Eric
Ramseur](http://eramseur.blogspot.com/ "asp.net 2.0 blog") who works on
the [Rainbow 2.0 Portal
project](http://community.rainbowportal.net/ "Rainbow 2.0 Community Site")
looks like he has made progress in[implementing Subtext as the blogging
module](http://community.rainbowportal.net/blogs/ramseurs_rainbow_portal_20_blog/archive/2006/04/07/11755.aspx "Ramseur Goes 2.0 on Subtext")
for Rainbow. That is pretty sweet.

I have to admit I do not know much about the Rainbow system other than
it is a Content Management System written in C\# with versions for
ASP.NET 1.1 and ASP.NET 2.0. It definitely bears investigation to see
how it compares and contrasts with DotNetNuke.

I am definitely interested in seeing how easy (or not) it is to
integrate [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Site")
into another system. One thing I have been working on when I have time
is to refactor Subtext to clean up some code and make it easier to
understand the source. As a team, we also hope to make the codebase even
more modularized. This stuff is fun.
