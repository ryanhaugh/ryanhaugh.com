Where have I been? ;) You probably heard the news already from the GU
already, but just in case, we will be shipping [JQueryÂ with Visual
Studio](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu/archive/2008/09/28/jquery-and-microsoft.aspx).
ASP.NET MVC will have the privilege of being one of the first products
to include JQuery. I am glad we finally announced this because I got
tired of stifling my mouth everytime someone suggested we just include
JQuery. :)

As you can see from [demos I've done in the
past](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/07/29/super-simple-mvc-ajax-with-jquery-demo.aspx),
JQuery will fit nicely with the ASP.NET MVC style of development.
