![The Evil Monkey In Chris's
Closet](http://haacked.com/images/evilmonkeyinchriscloset.jpg) This
[story from Boing
Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/06/delhi_hires_monkey_t.htm "Delhi Hires Monkey Thugs")
just cracks me up. Apparently monkeys have been harassing passengers of
Indiaâ€™s Delhi Metro. This has become such a problem that they have had
to hire some langurs (a fierce looking primate) along with a langur
wrangler to scare away the monkeys. Here is a description of one such
incident.

> In that incident, a monkey boarded a train at the underground Chawri
> Bazaar station and reportedly scared passengers by scowling at them
> for three stops. It then disembarked at Civil Lines station.
> Passengers had to be moved to another car while staff chased the
> dexterous creature, causing delays.

Bad monkey! Bad monkey!

As the Simpsons showed us, the monkeys **are** trying to take over the
world. The image above is from Family Guy.
