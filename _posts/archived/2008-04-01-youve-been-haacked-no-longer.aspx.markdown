UPDATE: This was an April Fool’s joke. I actually stated this in the
bottom of the original post, but in a very small font, which some people
noticed. :)

I’m totally done with blogging. Hanging my blogging hat and never
looking back. I started blogging on http://haack.org/ way back when
around 1998. I tried to include a [Wayback
Machine](http://web.archive.org/ "Wayback Machine") archive link, but
some domain squatters put a robots.txt file onto haack.org. Bummer.
Shoulda held onto that domain.

If you follow my twitter stream, you've probably noticed I've been
[lamenting](http://twitter.com/haacked/statuses/779866801 "Replace my blog")
[about](http://twitter.com/haacked/statuses/779406536 "Guilt")
[blogging](http://twitter.com/haacked/statuses/779407181 "Stick to it")
lately. A lot of bloggers, myself included, put an unhealthy amount of
pressure on themselves to continue producing content. It becomes a bit
of a self imposed boilerroom.

When I read about [Dare stopping his
blog](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/2008/03/05/IndefiniteHiatus.aspx "Hiatus"),
unlike many people who felt sad, I felt envious. Think of all the free
time he must’ve freed up. I can totally understand the reasons. He’s
getting ready to have a kid. I recently had one (almost 10 months ago).
All the time I spend on blogging, is time not spent with my wife and my
kid. I do have hobbies *other* than software.

Not only that, but a lot of the fun in blogging is gone. I feel like
discourse in the blogosphere has become so polarized lately, much like
the political climate in this country. People seem content with “Drive
By Commenting”, messing with someone’s day with a vitriolic comment
without regard for conseqences. I'm happy that people vehemently
disagree with each other and me, I wish we could keep the discourse
civil and focused on finding common ground. Just because I disagree with
you doesn’t mean I have to think your point is completely unreasonable
or that you’re stupid.

I’ll still read blogs and be on Twitter. The discourse isn’t much higher
on Twitter, but the time commitment is small enough to make it worth it.
**I predict blogging itself will be dead in a year anyway with everyone
moving to Twitter or Twitter-like services**.

Now that spring and summer is on its way to the Northwest, I think the
timing for this move is good. I know this will [disappoint many of my
friends](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001071.html "Blogging"),
but I have to do what’s right for me and my family. I hope you
understand.

 

Yes, this is an April Fool's Joke
