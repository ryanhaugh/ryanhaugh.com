Before I spend time writing my own, does anybody out there know of an
ASP.NET custom control that can render a nice interface for specifying a
connection string?

Honestly, I think a `TextBox` does a pretty fine job of it, but I have
to assume there are better options for those who donâ€™t have the various
connection string formats memorized. Ideally it would allow the user to
select whether they want to use a trusted or integrated security
connection, and based on that selection provide the correct fields to
fill out.
