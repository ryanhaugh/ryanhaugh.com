Take a look at the following code.

```csharp
 
const string input = "interesting";
        
bool comparison = input.ToUpper() == "INTERESTING";

Console.WriteLine("These things are equal: " + comparison);
Console.ReadLine();
```

Let’s imagine that `input` is actually user input or some value we get
from an API. That’s going to print out `These things are equal: True`
right? Right?!

Well not if you live in Turkey. Or more accurately, not if the current
culture of your operating system is `tr-TR` (which is likely if you live
in Turkey).

To prove this to ourselves, let’s force this application to run using
the Turkish locale. Here’s the full source code for a console
application that does this.

```csharp
using System;
using System.Globalization;
using System.Threading;
internal class Program
{
    private static void Main(string[] args)
    {      
        Thread.CurrentThread.CurrentCulture = new CultureInfo("tr-TR");
        const string input = "interesting";
        
        bool comparison = input.ToUpper() == "INTERESTING";

        Console.WriteLine("These things are equal: " + comparison);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

Now we’re seeing this print out `These things are equal: False`.

To understand why this is the case, I recommend reading much more
detailed treatments of this topic:

-   [Internationalization for Turkish: Dotted and Dotless Letter
    “I”](http://www.i18nguy.com/unicode/turkish-i18n.html "Internationalization Guy on Turkish I")
-   [What’s Wrong With
    Turkey](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/03/whats-wrong-with-turkey.html "What's Wrong With Turkey")

The tl;dr summary summary is that the uppercase for `i` in English is
`I` (note the lack of a dot) but in Turkish it’s dotted, `İ`. So while
we have two i’s (upper and lower), they have four.

My app is English only. AMURRICA!
---------------------------------

Even if you have no plans to translate your application into other
languages, your application can be affected by this. After all, the
sample I posted is English only.

Perhaps there aren’t going to be that many Turkish folks using your app,
but why subject the ones that do to easily preventable bugs? If you
don’t pay attention to this, it’s very easy to end up with a costly
security bug as a result.

The solution is simple. In most cases, when you compare strings, you
want to compare them using
`StringComparison.Ordinal or StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase`. It
just turns out there are so many ways to compare strings. It’s not just
`String.Equals`.

Code Analysis to the rescue
---------------------------

I’ve always been a fan of FxCop. At times it can seem to be a nagging
nanny constantly warning you about crap you don’t care about. But hidden
among all those warnings are some important rules that can prevent some
of these stupid bugs.

If you have the good fortune to start a project from scratch in Visual
Studio 2010 or later, I highly recommend enabling Code Analysis (FxCop
has been integrated into Visual Studio and is now called Code Analysis).
My recommendation is to pick a set of rules you care about and make sure
that the **build breaks if any of the rules are broken**. Don’t turn
them on as warnings because warnings are pointless noise. If it’s not
important enough to break the build, it’s not important enough to add
it.

Of course, many of us are dealing with existing code bases that haven’t
enforced these rules from the start. Adding in code analysis after the
fact is a daunting task. Here’s an approach I took recently that helped
me retain my sanity. At least what’s left of it.

First, I manually created a file with the following contents:

```csharp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RuleSet Name="PickAName" Description="Important Rules" ToolsVersion="10.0">
  <Rules AnalyzerId="Microsoft.Analyzers.ManagedCodeAnalysis"
      RuleNamespace="Microsoft.Rules.Managed">

    <Rule Id="CA1309" Action="Error" />    
  
  </Rules>
</RuleSet>
```

You could create one per project, but I decided to create one for my
solution. It’s just a pain to maintain multiple rule sets. I named this
file *SolutionName.ruleset* and put it in the root of my solution (the
name doesn’t matter. Just make the extension `.ruleset`)

I then configured each project that I cared about in my solution (I
ignored the unit test project) to enable code analysis using this
ruleset file. Just go to the project properties and select the *Code
Analysis* tab.

[![CodeAnalysisRuleSet](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/CodeAnalysisRuleSet_thumb.png "CodeAnalysisRuleSet")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/CodeAnalysisRuleSet_2.png)

I changed the selected Configuration to “All Configurations”. I also
checked the “Enable Code Analysis…” checkbox. I then clicked “Open” and
selected my ruleset file.

At this point, every time I build, Code Analysis will only run the one
rule,
[CA1309](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb385972.aspx "Use ordinal StringComparison"),
when I build. This way, adding more rules becomes manageable. Every time
I fixed a warning, I’d add that warning to this file one at a time. I
went through the following lists looking for important rules.

-   [Design
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182125 "Code Analysis Design Rules")
-   [Globalization
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182184 "Code Analysis Globalization Rules")
-   [Interoperability
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182193 "Code Analysis Interoperability Rules")
-   [Maintainability
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182211 "Code Analysis Maintainability Rules")
-   [Mobility
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182218 "Code Analysis Mobility Rules")
-   [Naming
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182232 "Code Analysis Naming Rules")
-   [Performance
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182260 "Code Analysis Performance Rules")
-   [Portability
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182282 "Code Analysis Portability Rules")
-   [Reliability
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182287 "Code Analysis Reliability Rules")
-   [Security
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182296 "Code Analysis Security Rules")
-   [Usage
    Warnings](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms182324 "Code Analysis Usage Rules")

I didn’t add every rule from each of these lists, only the ones I
thought were important.

At some point, I reached the point where I was including a large number
of rules and it made sense for me to invert the list so rather than
listing all the rules I want to include, I only listed the ones I wanted
to exclude.

```csharp
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<RuleSet Name="PickAName" Description="Important Rules" ToolsVersion="10.0">
  <IncludeAll Action="Error" />
  <Rules AnalyzerId="Microsoft.Analyzers.ManagedCodeAnalysis"
      RuleNamespace="Microsoft.Rules.Managed">

    <Rule Id="CA1704" Action="None" />    
  
  </Rules>
</RuleSet>
```

Notice the `IncludeAll` element now makes every code analysis warning
into an error, but then I turn CA1704 off in the list.

Note that you don’t have to edit this file by hand. If you open the
ruleset in Visual Studio it’ll provide a GUI editor. I prefer to simply
edit the file.

[![RuleSetEditor](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/RuleSetEditor_thumb.png "RuleSetEditor")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/70bb1ffd73a5_C2A0/RuleSetEditor_2.png)

One other thing I did was for really important rules where there were
too many issues to fix in a timely manner, I would simply use Visual
Studio to suppress all of them and commit that. At least that ensured
that no new violations of the rule would be committed. That allowed me
to fix the existing ones at my leisure.

I’ve found this approach makes using code analysis way more useful and
less painful than simply turning on every rule and hoping for the best.
Hope you find this helpful as well. May you never ship a bug with the
Turkish I problem again!
