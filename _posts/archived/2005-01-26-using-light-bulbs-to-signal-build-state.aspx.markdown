![Build Lights](/images/buildlights.jpg) Oh yes, this is geeky! [Craig
Wangdera](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.BuildLightsCode)
posted the source code he wrote that lights up physical light bulbs with
the status of his build using
[CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/). For
example, the yellow bulb lights up when a build is in progress while a
green bulb lights up if the last build was successful. See the full size
picture and source
