Once again, those crazy fools [Richard
Campbell](http://www.campbellassociates.ca/blog/ "Richard Campbell's Blog")
and [Carl Franklin](http://carlfranklin.net/ "Carl Franklin's Blog") are
touring around this great country of ours in a big ass RV as part of
their [.NET Rocks Road
Trip](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/roadtrip.aspx ".NET Rocks Road Trip").
Last time it was for the launch of Visual Studio 2010. This time it
coincides with Visual Studio 2012.

At each stop these gentlemen each give a presentation and then they
interview a guest. If you’re in Los Angeles this Friday (November 30,
2012), you’re stuck with me as the guest. So stop on by and we’ll try to
keep it interesting. If not, we’ll go out for some drinks afterwards and
something interesting is bound to happen. These two fellas are full of
mischief.

If you do plan to show up, please [register
here](https://msevents.microsoft.com/CUI/EventDetail.aspx?EventID=1032537457&Culture=en-US&community=0 "Register for .NET Rocks Road Trip Los Angeles")
so they can get a rough headcount. I won’t make any promises as I’m
notoriously forgetful about these things, but I’ll bring a copy of
[Professional ASP.NET MVC
4](https://www.amazon.com/dp/111834846X/ref=as_li_ss_til?tag=youvebeenhaac-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=111834846X&adid=1S9J5060VMAHHP8FY145& "Professional ASP.NET MVC 4")
to give away as well as some GitHub and NuGet stickers.

The last time they had a roadshow I [joined them in Mountain View,
CA](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=543 "Haack on .NET Rocks Road Trip 2010")
and we had a blast. This time, I’m excited to return to Los Angeles
where I went to college and had my first programming job.
