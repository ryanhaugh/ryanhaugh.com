![Kill Bill Vol2](/images/killbillvol2.jpg)**Kill Bill**\
 We finished Kill Bill Vol 2 last night and absolutely loved the entire
movie. By entire movie, I mean part 1 & 2 combined. Part 1 was a more
visual feast while the second produced the story and dialogue we expect
from Q. My wife puts it among her favorites, mainly because she loves
any movies with "Girl Power".

**Women of XML**\
 This brings me to the topic of "Women Power!" in relation to
technology. [Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) posts this most
excellent
[list](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=c74eebda-4ccb-48b6-ba6c-06bc2cf08c79)
of some of the top women in XML.

This list is very encouraging. I have to admit, that personally, I've
never worked with a female software developer or system administrator
except for the first month or so of my first job. And this isn't for
lack of trying. At my first company, the president was a woman, and all
of our project managers were women as well. But the developers were all
men. When we were hiring, my boss really hoped to see some qualified
women come in to interview. If memory serves me correct, I remember
interviewing a grand total of one woman. That's all that responded!

Unfortunately, there's a lot of factors involved that have kept women
out of technology. Naturally, there's the workplace chauvinism
encountered in the old days (and I'm sure even now). But there's also
the bias that the current generation of employable women faced as young
girls and in school. When you have a talking Barbie doll that says "Gee,
Math is HARD!", what kind of message are you sending young girls?

Apart from the subtle sexism, there's also the fact that programming
hasn't been marketed to women very well. It has no "sex appeal".
Hopefully this is starting to change, but when the general public thinks
about programmers, there's the image of the anti-social grungy pizza
loving Coke fiend (cola I mean) who is isolated and seeks glory by
working 80 hr weeks to put out the next version of "Kill Everything That
Moves And Make Them Bleed" first-person shooter.

Where is the Ally McBeal of software development!? There's nothing
inherently sexier about Law (as my lawyer friends can attest) than
software. No really. Really!
