Don Park outlines an interesting [potential
solution](http://www.docuverse.com/blog/donpark/EntryViewPage.aspx?guid=676e38b4-0db9-4c7b-9692-b285fa5d0918)
to Google's proposed Auto Link feature of its Toolbar. Essentially his
solution is to allow content author's to opt-in via tagging content for
auto-linking.

The question I have about this is if you're going to go to all the
trouble to mark up your content in this way, why not just provide the
link yourself? One benefit I do see is in the case of an ISBN number. As
a content producer, I might link to [Amazon](http://www.amazon.com/).
However, if my user has an account at
[BookPool](http://www.bookpool.com/), she might configure the auto-link
toolbar to link ISBNs to that site instead.

Of course, in general, I might not want that since I'd prefer to get
credit for links to Amazon. But that's beside the point. If I opt in,
it's the potential to give users more control. This assumes that Google
gives user that level of control.

Another question I have is if content authors start using this tag, what
stops browsers from adding AutoLink to pages that opt-in? In effect,
Don's suggestion creates an extension to HTML and by being opt-in,
anybody should be able to hook into that, not just Google.

I'm not sure Google would want to go that route. Microsoft had its hand
slapped by attempting an auto-link. Google perhaps thinks it can squeeze
by since it's not a monopoly power on the desktop and it promises to "do
no evil". But by making AutoLink opt-in, that should in theory make it
palatable for browsers such as IE and FireFox add that feature.

Ultimately, I think AutoLink would be a great feature if it was
controlled by the users. A user could control links to addresses so that
they go to his or her favorite [mapping site](http://maps.google.com/)
and an ISBN would link to the user's [favorite
bookseller](http://www.amazon.com/).
