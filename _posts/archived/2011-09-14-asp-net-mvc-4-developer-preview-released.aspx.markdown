Today, during his [//BUILD
keynote](http://www.buildwindows.com/ "Build Windows"), [Scott
Guthrie](http://weblogs.asp.net/scottgu "Scott Guthrie's Blog")
announced the availability of **[ASP.NET MVC 4 Developer
preview](http://asp.net/mvc/mvc4 "ASP.NET MVC 4")**. Note those words,
**developer preview**. This is *not even a Beta* release. But there sure
is a lot of cool stuff inside.

One great thing about this release is that the runtime libraries (our
assemblies) as well as our JavaScript libraries are available as NuGet
packages. So if you write packages that depend on the ASP.NET MVC 4
runtime, you can have them depend on our packages.

Also included in this release is NuGet 1.5 which was [released just
recently](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/08/30/nuget-1-5-released.aspx "NuGet 1.5 released").
If you already have NuGet 1.5 installed, you may notice there’s a new
update available.  This new version includes support for Visual Studio
11 Developer Preview. There are no other changes in it.

I’m also giving a [couple of talks at
BUILD](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/09/13/speaking-at-build.aspx "Speaking at BUILD")
that you’ll be able to watch online that cover some of the features
within ASP.NET MVC 4. To find out more about the release, visit our
[ASP.NET MVC 4 information
page](http://asp.net/mvc/mvc4 "ASP.NET MVC 4").

Install it
----------

You can install it via the Web Platform installer:

-   [ASP.NET MVC 4 for Visual Studio
    2010](http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=MVC4VS2010&prerelease=true "ASP.NET MVC 4 for Visual Studio 2010")
-   [ASP.NET MVC 4 for Visual Studio 11 Developer
    Preview](http://www.microsoft.com/web/gallery/install.aspx?appid=MVC4VS11&prerelease=true "ASP.NET MVC 4 for Visual Studio 2011").

Or if you prefer to download the installers directly, visit the
[**download details
page**](http://www.microsoft.com/download/en/details.aspx?displaylang=en&id=27419 "ASP.NET MVC 4 Developer Preview Download Page").

We also published an [ASP.NET MVC 3 installer for Visual Studio 11
Developer
Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=229256 "ASP.NET MVC 3 for Visual Studio 11")
if you’d like to try that out.

Closing Thoughts
----------------

I’m excited about this release and will be interested to hear your
feedback. I also want to recognize the heroic efforts of the ASP.NET MVC
team (and NuGet and ASP.NET Web Pages) to get this release ready in time
with all the features that it contains. I’m privileged to work with such
great folks.
