Someone pointed this out to me on [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/).
A book entitled [How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian
Men](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/customer-reviews/0919637264/ref=cm_cr_dp_2_1/102-0653022-3412114?me=ATVPDKIKX0DER "How to Date a White Woman: A Practical Guide for Asian Men").

The fact that such a book exists leaves me speechless. I didn’t realize
there was a demand by asian men to seek out specifically white women.
Perhaps it’s a backlash against the perceived phenomenon of white men
"stealing" asian women. This is absolute hilarity.

Then again, being biracial myself, I can only say I support more
interracial coupling. Viva Hapas! The real humor is in the customer
reviews for the book. For example check out this one from a reviewer in
Brooklyn:

> I suppose I really have only myself to blame, but based on a cursory
> glance at its title, I assumed that this book was about forensic
> techniques for identifying the age of bones, along with other remains
> and artifacts. If, like me, you are looking for any insight into the
> applications of C-14 comparisons, strontium decay or the like, you
> will be disappointed. However, I gave this book to a friend of mine,
> Arthur Fong, who said he appreciated it.

Too bad there’s no sample pages because I’m dying of curiosity to see
what hackneyed tips the author provides. I’ll tell you the best tip for
dating a person of a particular race (not that I condone dating people
specifically for the color of their skin). Spend time where they are.

Studies show that the major determinant in who you marry is your
proximity to such person. You want to marry a white woman, find out
where there are high concentrations of white women. Want to marry a rich
woman, hang out in the Hamptons. Oh, and it wouldn’t hurt to shower
often and treat them with respect.
