interesting
look](http://spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/Blog/cns!1pCvw_V_FwCgTXneX4GXlXLw!460.entry)
at how blogs have some influence within the Senate confirmation hearings
for Judge Roberts.

Now I just need to get these Senators to read my blog so they can ask
the really pertinent questions such as:

-   Are you an “in-y” or an “outy”?
-   Boxers or Briefs?
-   Tastes Great or Less Filling?
-   Mac, Windows or Linux?
-   Will you be the first Supreme Court Justice in history to have a
    blog? (*editor note: Yeah, right.*)
-   Value Type or Reference Type? And if Reference Type, in which
    circumstances would you implement IDisposable and in which cases
    would you choose to implement a finalizer? Please frame your answer
    by considering how the power of Eminent Domain figures or doesn’t
    figure into this discussion.

The public wants to know!
