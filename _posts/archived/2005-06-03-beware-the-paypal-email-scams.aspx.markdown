Looking at my SPAM filter, I notice that nearly a quarter of my emails
appear to be from PayPal. Of course, these are all spoofed to appear
that way.

Instead, fire up your browser of choice, and type in www.paypal.com in
the address bar. Nearly all of these emails are fakes. Here’s an example
of a particularly tricky one that raised alarms and almost caused a knee
jerk reaction till I realized it was a fake. It played upon a simple
fear.

> PayPal Email ID PP007

This is a standard notice when adding a new email address to your PayPal
account. What caught my attention is that the email address has the name
brian. My brother is named Brian, so instinctually I wondered if he made
a mistake with his own paypal account, adding me as an address.

But soon, I realized that this has to be a scam, simply because EVERY
email I seemingly get from PayPal appears to be a scam.

Notice the URL *https://www.paypal.com/row/wf/f=ap\_email* so helpfully
included to ostensibly help you contact PayPal customer service. In my
email, this was a link. When I hovered my mouse over it, it’s displays a
completely different URL at some server with the IP 220.80.212.211. A
quick DNS Lookup shows this is not a PayPal server.

In fact, EVERY "link" in this URL points to that IP address, even the
word *brian12313@yahoo.com* which you would expect to be a mailto: link.
Very sneaky.
