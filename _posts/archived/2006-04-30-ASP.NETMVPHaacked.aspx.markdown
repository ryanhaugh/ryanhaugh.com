![ASP.NET 2.0 MVP Hacks and
Tips](http://haacked.com/images/ASP.NET_Hacks.jpg) [Scott Hanselman
mentions a new
book](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ASPNETMVPHacks.aspx "ASP.NET MVP Hacks")
in which he is one of the coauthors featured on the cover. Yes, they
**do** look like they are throwing the twelve sided dice on a table with
meticulously painted miniatures. If you have no idea what I am talking
about, you have never embraced the inner geek.

The reason I mention this is that In 2005 I wrote a post in which I
presented an [Abstract Boilerplate
HttpHandler](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/03/17/2394.aspx "Boilerplate HttpHandler").
This particular post was inspired and built upon Scottâ€™s [original
(non-abstract) boilerplate
HttpHandler](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,5c59d662-b250-4eb2-96e4-f274295bd52e.aspx "Boilerplate HttpHandler").
And now it comes full circle as Scott has borrowed from my borrowing,
cleaned it up a bit, put a tie and suit on it, and then put it in a
book.

Nice work! Now in order to one-up him, I will have to borrow from the
book (which would be borrowing from a borrowed borrow) and get a
Hollywood movie made. Keanu Reeves stars in *Abstract Boilerplate
HttpHandler I - The Pipeline of Opportunity*.

So among this book of MVP hacks, they have inadvertently included a
Haack.
