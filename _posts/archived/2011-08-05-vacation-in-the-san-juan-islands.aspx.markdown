A few weeks ago I felt burned out and was in sore need of a vacation. I
suggested to my wife that we take the kids somewhere and she sagely
noted that taking the kids anywhere at their ages is not a vacation.
Perhaps I should go somewhere on my own.

[![IMG\_1551](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Vacation-in-the-San-Juan-Islands_E90E/IMG_1551_thumb.jpg "IMG_1551")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Vacation-in-the-San-Juan-Islands_E90E/IMG_1551.jpg)*Like
a deserted lighthouse!*Did I mention she’s the best wife ever?

I decided to take a week off and mix a bit of “staycation” with my
vacation. Spend a few days at home and maybe a couple of days away.

The first thing I did was call up
[Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog") who was game
for a trip to Los Angeles for [E3](http://www.e3expo.com/ "E3 expo").
Unfortunately that fell through when we couldn’t score tickets (yes,
we’re cheap). We did find some guy on Craigslist who could score us
cheap tickets, but his badges looked hand-drawn and made me a wee bit
suspicious. I seriously doubt E3 uses Comic Sans as their badge font.

After much deliberation, I decided to take a trip to the nearby San Juan
Island for two nights. The plan was to go sea kayaking, but based on the
glowing reports of my co-worker [Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson"), I also decided to
try
[ziplining](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zip-line "Zip-Line on Wikipedia").

Kenmore Air
-----------

There are two ways to get to San Juan Island, take a ferry or fly. Well,
you could also try to swim, but I wouldn’t much recommend it. A ferry is
much cheaper, but it’ll take you three hours to get there. Not only
that, the view doesn’t compare to that of an airplane that takes off and
lands on water. So I went with a sea plane, figuring taking off and
landing on water would be really fun.

The plane was cozy (aka small) which allowed me to sit right behind the
cockpit and enjoy a panoramic view during the flight to the island. The
landing was whisper soft and I barely noticed it.

I wonder what this button does.*I even had the opportunity to help out
by holding the mooring rope for the pilot while he got in to start the
plane and take off. I thought about holding onto the rope for an
exhilarating ride, but my better judgment kicked in.

going to tell me when to let go right? RIGHT?!*

Friday Harbor House
-------------------

It was a short walk to the [Friday Harbor
House](http://www.fridayharborhouse.com/ "Friday Harbor House"), my
lodgings for the trip. I splurged a bit for a room with a view
overlooking the harbor, affording me a view of the incoming sea planes
and ferries. I also had a view of the folks dining in the garden just
outside the restaurant downstairs under my balcony.

*The view of the harbor from my room.*

And their view was supplemented by a direct view into my room, keen as I
was to keep my window open. Fortunately (for them or for me, I can’t
decide), I noticed this before having the occasion to create a very
awkward moment.

Unlike most vacations, I actually did spend a lot of time in my room
curled up with a [good
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/076790818X/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=217145&creative=399369&creativeASIN=076790818X "A Short History of Nearly Everything - Bill Bryson")
while enjoying a nice view, so the extra money for the view was well
spent.

As a bonus, I learned that the restaurant just under my room was
considered by many on the island to be one of the better restaurants.

Ziplining
---------

If you find yourself on San Juan Island, I highly recommend setting
apart a bit of time (around 3 hrs) to go ziplining with [Zip San
Juan](http://www.zipsanjuan.com/ "Zip San Juan"). It’s a small operation
run by a [husband and wife team](http://www.zipsanjuan.com/about.php)
who exude competence while being extremely friendly. Pat even fashions
himself to be a bit of a comedian. I’ll only say I was indeed
entertained on the drive there and back.

*You better believe I’m not letting go of this rope.*

The group I ended up with was a rambunctious extended family on a trip
from their home state of Ohio. They graciously treated me as part of
their family which apparently means enduring sarcastic quips for the
duration of the trip.

Flinging yourself off of a platform bolted 50 feet up a tree harnessed
to a cable is surprisingly a lot of fun. Unless you’re deathly afraid of
heights. We ran through eight different lines each more interesting than
the previous.

Sea Kayaking
------------

For sea kayaking I went with [Discovery Sea
Kayaks](http://www.discoveryseakayak.com/ "discovery sea kayaks"). They
are an outfit that is committed to keeping the size of their tours
small. My tour had five folks, not counting the guide. I saw another
group with what looked like 12 people.

A tour starts with a brief tutorial on safety and proper paddling before
setting out in a set of double canoes. We set out on the west side of
the island with a nice view of Canada across the sound. We didn’t catch
any whales but did see jellyfish, sea lions, and some doll porpoises.

[![IMG\_1584](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Vacation-in-the-San-Juan-Islands_E90E/IMG_1584_thumb.jpg "IMG_1584")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Vacation-in-the-San-Juan-Islands_E90E/IMG_1584.jpg)*Who
said anything about having to actually paddle?*

I was fortunate to be sharing a canoe with the guide ensuring I wouldn’t
have any problems hearing the guide as he regaled us with interesting
stories about the island’s history and our natural surroundings.

I spent two days and two nights on the Island before returning home
feeling much refreshed. I look forward to the next opportunity to take
such a trip and highly recommend it if you feel yourself being weighed
down by work.
