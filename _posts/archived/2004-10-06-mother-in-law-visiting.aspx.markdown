Akumi's mother is visiting us from Tokyo for a couple weeks. I have to
say, if she decided she wanted to move in, I would not complain.

The other day she cooked us a fantastic Japanese dinner, with a couple
dishes I had never tried before. When I got home yesterday, she had
cleaned our back patio and fed the dog.

The only problem is that she doesn't speak much English (though she
understands more than she lets on) and I speak even less Japanese. So we
don't spend a lot of time in conversation, but she seems to enjoy my
style of physical comedy (intentional or not).
