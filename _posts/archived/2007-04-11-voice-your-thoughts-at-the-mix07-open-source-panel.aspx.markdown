[Rob Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery") is [soliciting our
feedback](http://blog.wekeroad.com/archive/2007/04/12/The-MIX07-Open-Source-Panel-I-Need-Your-Questions.aspx "I Need Your Questions")
for a panel on Open Source that he᾿ll be participating in at Mix07.

He᾿s joined by some big names in the world of Open Source Software
including [Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel de Icaza").
Hot Damn!

I won᾿t lie, I did want to be a part of the panel when I first heard
about it (in part to get a free ticket, but also be cause I love hearing
myself talk about Open Source) but did not make the cut. Now I see why
and I᾿m kind of glad I᾿m not up there risking looking like a fool next
to those guys.

Not to say that Rob is going to look foolish. He᾿s got a lot of smarts.
You᾿ll do fine Rob! Trust me.
