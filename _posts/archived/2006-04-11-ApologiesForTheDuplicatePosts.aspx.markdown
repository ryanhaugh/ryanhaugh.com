If you are seeing duplicate posts from my blog in your feed aggregator,
my apologies. I am dogfooding the latest development version of Subtext
straight from the Subversion repository. Unfortunately, my unit tests
did not catch the fact that I changed the `link` and `guid` elements
from fully qualified to virtual URLs.

Doh!

I should have a fix soon.

UPDATE: All fixed. Sorry for the brief disruption.
