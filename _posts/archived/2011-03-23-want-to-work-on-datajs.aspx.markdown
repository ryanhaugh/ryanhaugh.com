A colleague of mine from the Data and Modeling Group mentioned that they
have a new senior developer position open working on their new datajs
project.

This developer would be responsible for defining how modern web and
mobile applications use and interact with data on JavaScript platforms.
We deal with and work on defining a number of standards including
HTML5’s IndexedDB and OData, as well as provide a new set of end-to-end
experiences for accessing, managing, and storing data in JS.

What’s interesting to me is that datajs appears to be an open source
project under the [MIT license](http://datajs.codeplex.com/license)!

From its description on the [datajs CodePlex
page](http://datajs.codeplex.com/ "datajs on CodePlex"),

> datajs is a new cross-browser JavaScript library that enables
> data-centric web applications by leveraging modern protocols such as
> JSON and OData and HTML5-enabled browser features. It's designed to be
> small, fast and easy to use. \

For more details about the position, check out the [job posting
online](https://careers.microsoft.com/JobDetails.aspx?ss=&pg=0&so=&rw=1&jid=38274&jlang=EN "datajs job posting").

For those of you who are interested but don’t live in Redmond,
Washington, this position is in Redmond and requires relocation.

**How do I apply?**

If you’re interested in the position, please contact Jeff Derstadt
[**jeffders@microsoft.com**](mailto:jeffders@microsoft.com). I don’t
know anything more about the job than what I posted here in this blog
post.

I do know that I’ve worked with people on that team as partners on in
various capacities and they’re smart folks doing good work. I’m sure my
team and your team (should you get the job) would end up working closely
together.
