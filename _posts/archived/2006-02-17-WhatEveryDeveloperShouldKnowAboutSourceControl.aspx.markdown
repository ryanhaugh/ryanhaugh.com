If you are like me, you “learned” source control in a very informal
manner. Perhaps you learned via what we used to call the “Commodore
Shuffle” back in the day (what is the modern term for this?) in which
you clicked around and figured it out by trying to use it.

Heck, with Visual Studio integration, Visual Source Safe is pretty easy
to learn. When you double click a file to edit it, VSS kicks in and asks
you to check it out. That effectively puts that file under lock and key
and nobody else can edit that sucker until you check it back in.

For several years, I thought this process defined source control (also
called version control). Up until working professionally, I had never
even heard of source control. My college computer science courses never
covered it. Why should they? Everything we wrote for class was pretty
much throwaway code.

Fortunately [Eric Sink](http://software.ericsink.com/ "Eric Sink Blog")
comes along and enlightens the masses with his series on Source Control
called [Source Control
HOWTO](http://software.ericsink.com/scm/source_control.html "Source Control Tutorial").
If there are better or equivalent series on this topic, let me know in
the comments.

This is the guide I wished I had when first starting out. If you think
you know source control, but have never created a branch in your life,
have never worked with an optimistic locking version control system,
then you owe it to yourself to read this series and gain an
understanding of these topics, whether you end up using them or not.
