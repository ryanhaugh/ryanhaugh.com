Just a quick [follow-up to my last
posts](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/10/22/naming-is-hard.aspx "Naming is hard")
about naming NuPack. Looks like the community is not content to sit back
and let the project be labelled with a lame name. Iâ€™ve seen a couple of
community inspired names created as new issues in the CodePlex issue
tracker.

However, [NFetch has a huge
lead](http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/273 "NFetch"), but the
community chosen [NRocks is a close
second](http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/276 "NRocks"). The name I
like the best so far is NuGet.

([**vote for it
here**](http://nupack.codeplex.com/workitem/282 "Vote for NuGet"))

As before, **voting still closes on Tuesday 10/26 at 11:59 PM PDT**. If
you feel strongly enough around a name, rally your friends to vote for
one.
