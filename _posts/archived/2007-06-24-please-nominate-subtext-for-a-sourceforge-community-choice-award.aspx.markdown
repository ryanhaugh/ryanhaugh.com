request to nominate
Subtext](http://stevenharman.net/blog/archive/2007/06/24/nominate-subtext-for-a-2007-community-choice-award.aspx "Nominate Subtext for a 2007 Community Choice Award")
for a SourceForge 2007 Community Choice Award.

> The SourceForge.net team is proud to present our second annual
> Community Choice Awards. Winners are selected by community members
> like you, and it’s that time again! Cast a ballot for your favorite
> projects now and make your voice heard.

To nominate Subtext, just click on the badge below:

[![nomProj](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/PleaseNominateSubtextForASourceForgeComm_FAAD/nomProj_1.png)](http://sourceforge.net/awards/cca/nomination.php?group_id=137896&from=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Fsubtext%2F "Nominate Subtext")

Nominations are accepted until June 29th, at which point the projects
with the most nominations become finalists. You can nominate a project
once per category. The ones that I think best fits Subtext are:

-   **Most Collaborative Project:** The project most likely to accept
    your patches and value your input
-   **Best Project for Communications:** The best project for talking to
    your friends or sharing information
-   **Best Project:** This is the one! The all-over best project. (*hey,
    this is a bit reaching, but it doesn’t hurt to try, no?*)

If Subtext makes the finalists, then vote for us from July 9th to July
26th at the following URL:

[http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/landing-pages/cca07/](http://sourceforge.net/community/index.php/landing-pages/cca07/)

Don’t worry, if that happens, I’ll remind you. :)

We appreciate your nomination. Heck, I’ll appreciate it if you
just thought about it for a moment and moved on.
