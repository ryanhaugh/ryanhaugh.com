My last post covered how to [improve your Git experience on Windows using PowerShell, Posh-Git, and PsGet](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/12/13/better-git-with-powershell.aspx "Better Git with PowerShell").
However, a commenter reminded me that a lot of folks don’t know how to get Git for Windows in the first place.

And once you do get Git set up, how do you avoid getting prompted all the time for your credentials when you push changes back to your repository (or pull from a private repository)?

I’ll answer both of those questions in this post.

Install msysgit
---------------

The first step is to install [Git for Windows](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/ "msysgit") (aka msysgit). The
full installer for [msysgit 1.7.8 is here](http://code.google.com/p/msysgit/downloads/detail?name=Git-1.7.8-preview20111206.exe&can=3&q=official+Git "Installer"). For a detailed walkthrough of the setup steps, check out [GItHub’s Windows Setup walkthrough](http://help.github.com/win-set-up-git/ "Setting up Git for Windows").
It’s pretty straightforward. That’ll put Git.exe in your path so that
[Posh-Git](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git "Posh-Git on GitHub")
will work.

Bam! Done! On to the second question. Make sure you set up your SSH keys
before moving to the second section.

Using SSH with Posh-Git
-----------------------

One annoyance with Git on Windows is when pushing changes to a
repository (or pulling from a private repository), you have to
constantly enter your password if you cloned the repository using HTTPS.

Likewise, if you clone with SSH, you also need to enter your passphrase
each time. Fortunately, a little program called *ssh-agent* can securely
save your pass phrase (and consequently your sanity) for the session and
supply it when needed.

**Update:** [Mike Chaliy](http://chaliy.name/ "Mike Chaliy") just fixed
PsGet so it always grabs the latest version of Posh-Git. If you
installed Posh-Git before today using PsGet, you’ll need to update
Posh-Git by running the following command:

```csharp
Install-Module Posh-Git –force
```

Unfortunately, at the time that I write this, the version of Posh-Git
in PsGet does not support starting an SSH Agent. The good news is, the
latest version of Posh-Git direct from [their GitHub
repository](https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git "Posh-Git on GitHub") does
support SSH Agent.

Since the previous step installed git.exe on my machine, all I needed
to do to get the latest version of Posh-Git is to clone the
repository.

```csharp
git clone https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git.git
```

This creates a folder named “posh-git” in the directory where you ran
the command. I then copied all the files in that folder into the place
where PsGet installed posh-git. On my machine, that was:

*C:\\Users\\Haacked\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\posh-git*

When I restarted my PowerShell prompt, it told me it could not start SSH
Agent.

[![powershell-ssh-agent-not-found](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Get-Git-For-Windows_D671/powershell-ssh-agent-not-found_thumb.png "powershell-ssh-agent-not-found")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Get-Git-For-Windows_D671/powershell-ssh-agent-not-found_2.png)

It turns out that it was not able to find the “ssh-agent.exe”
executable. That file is located in *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Git\\bin*.
but that folder isn’t automatically added to your PATH by msysgit.

If you don’t want to add this path to your system PATH, you can update
your PowerShell profile script so it only applies to your PowerShell
session. Here’s the change I made.

```csharp
$env:path += ";" + (Get-Item "Env:ProgramFiles(x86)").Value + "\Git\bin"
```

On my machine that script is at:

*C:\\Users\\Haacked\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\**Microsoft.Powershell\_profile.ps1***

The next time I opened my PowerShell prompt, I was greeted with a
request for my pass phrase.

[![powershell-ssh-agent](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Get-Git-For-Windows_D671/powershell-ssh-agent_thumb.png "powershell-ssh-agent")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Get-Git-For-Windows_D671/powershell-ssh-agent_2.png)

After typing in my super secret pass phrase, once at the beginning of
the session, I was set. I could clone some private repositories and push
some changes without having to specify my pass phrase each time. Nice.
Secure. Convenient.

The Start-SshAgent Command
--------------------------

The reason that I get the ssh-agent prompt when starting up PowerShell
is because when I installed Posh-Git, it updated my profile to load in
their example profile:

*C:\\Users\\Haacked\\Documents\\WindowsPowerShell\\Modules\\**posh-git\\profile.example.ps1***

That profile script is calling the `Start-SshAgent` command which is
included with Posh-Git. If you don’t like their profile example, you can
manually start ssh-agent by calling the `Start-SshAgent` command.
