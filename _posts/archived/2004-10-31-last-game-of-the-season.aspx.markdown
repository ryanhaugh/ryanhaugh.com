![Soccer Ball](/images/soccerball.JPG) Today the soccer team I started
playing with had their last game of the season. This was only my second
game with them and we were playing the first place team in the league.
This team was much slower than our last opponent and not as skillful,
but were known for playing very dirty.

Fortunately on this day, the ref ran a tight ship and a nice game of
soccer ensued. At least nice for the other team who proceeded to pound
us for five goals to our two. We started off strong, but with no subs to
speak of, the second half found us weary and unable to keep up.

The highlight for me was putting the ball in the back of the net in my
second game with this team. The play involved flicking the ball over the
defender and taking a shot off the bounce. They invited me to join them
when the season starts in January. Hopefully by then I'll have some
fitness to contribute.
