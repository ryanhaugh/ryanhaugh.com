I did another interview with those wild and crazy guys,
[Carl](http://www.intellectualhedonism.com/ "Carl") and
[Richard](http://www.campbellassociates.ca/blog/default.aspx "Richard Campbell").
My first time (show 261) being on .NET Rocks was [back in August of
2007](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=261 "Phil on .NET Rocks")
when I talked about Subtext, Open Source, and my blog.

[This
time](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=339 "This time")
(show 339), the interview focused on my experiences with working at
Microsoft and the work I do on the ASP.NET MVC project. Notice that my
profile pic hasn’t changed at all. I should do something about that.

I haven’t listened to it yet as I hate hearing myself talk. Even worse
is seeing [myself on
video](http://weblogs.asp.net/craigshoemaker/archive/2008/05/01/what-s-it-gonna-take-to-get-asp-net-mvc-to-rtm.aspx "What will it take to RTM MVC?").

In any case, if you are interested, take a listen to the latest [**.NET
Rocks
show**](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=339 "Me on .NET Rocks").

Oh, and I was also a guest [on Hanselminutes
recently](http://www.hanselminutes.com/default.aspx?showID=129 "Hanselminutes").
That talk was recorded at ALT.NET Open Spaces in Seattle. It’s only a
coincidence that these two interviews came out a week apart. They were
recorded more than a week apart. Honestly, I’m not a microphone whore.
I’m more of a camera whore. ;)
