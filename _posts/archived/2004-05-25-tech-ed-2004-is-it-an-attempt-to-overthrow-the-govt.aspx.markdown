My good [buddy](http://koba.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/) makes the
following comment on my last post:

Now that you've spoken the truth, you must be punished. You are hereby
forced to use Windows ME for the rest of your life!

Sorry, nothing that insidious is happening here. Ballmer's keynote
focused on Microsoft's mission for IT which is to help IT "Do More With
Less". Sadly, IT is already doing more with less. Less people. Less
resources. Less moral. More hours.

For me, the most interesting announcement made was about Visual
Studio.NET Team edition which will attempt to improve the software
development lifecycle. This product integrates unit testing, deployment
configuration (via Whitehorse), collaboration and workflow management,
improved source control with the IDE. Yes, they are improving
sourcesafe.

As for overthrowing the government, Ballmer did mention that Oracle is
now a VSIP (Visual Studio Integration Partner). Larry Ellison partnering
with Microsoft on any level? Either they've tied Larry up and locked him
away, or there's something brewing here...
