Let's see. On Friday we went to see a sneak preview of Starsky and
Hutch. If you liked Zoolander, I think you'll like this. It's not the
same, but has similar type of humor. It's hard to approach Zoolander in
my book, but Starksy and Hutch does well.

Saturday played a game of soccer in the cold rain. Had a stalwart crew
of 10 people out there.

And on Sunday, slept in till noon, had lunch in Eagle Rock, and
basically had a nice relaxing lazy day.
