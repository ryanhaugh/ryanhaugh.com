![Shoes](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/IdLikeToBeInJoelsShoes_F874/BlackBoots6.jpg)Of
course that assumes that Joel wears a size 9 and a half.

Once again the ***Joel Cycle*** takes another turn.  The cycle goes
something like this:

-   Joel [critiques something or
    other](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2006/09/12.html).
-   Bloggers counter Joel’s claims, many with [thoughtful counter
    arguments](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/12/Joel_On_Ruby_Performance.aspx).
-   Soon a flood of comments and posts start to turn a bit ugly and form
    around two camps: The *Joel is an idiot why do you even read him?*
    camp and the *Joel is successful, what have you ever done that you
    can disagree with him?* camp.
-   Rinse and Repeat

It really is an interesting phenomenon to watch and participate in.  For
example, I’ve had my blog post lumped in as part of the *[angry lynch
mob](http://voxpopdesign.com/bloomburst/1/2006/09/spolsky-questions-ruby-gets-angry-mob.cfm)* out
to get Joel.  All I said was that I found his argument unconvincing.  Am
I really a part of a mob conspiracy?

Now before anyone jumps down my throat, let me clarify something very
important.  **I have tremendous amount of respect for Joel Spolsky.** 
There, I said it.  I can’t speak for [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000679.html), but I
would venture to guess that he too has a lot of respect for Joel,
despite the big red WTF on his forehead.

Anyone who has thousands of developers dissecting his every blog post
and arguing the pros and cons of how he runs his company is doing
something very right.  I’d love to be in those shoes, running a very
successful company with thousands of people invested in what I do and
how I do it, whether positively or negatively.

If I were to blog something stupid (and I’m not saying he did, but just
for the sake of argument, sheesh!), I’d be lucky to get a couple
comments to the effect, “Dude, you’re an idiot.”  Heck, I’d be happy if
I even generated *that* level of passion. Rather I’d probably get a
comment to the effect of, “**I disagree. Nice Post! Buy Xanax**”.

The other reaction Joel commonly gets is the *I don’t know why y’all are
reading him, I gave that shit up a long time ago* reaction. I also don’t
understand this reaction.  For the most part, I think Joel’s signal to
noise ratio is very high, and he’s written some really top notch
articles on his blog.  Just because he says a few things from time to
time that you disagree with doesn’t mean you should throw the baby out
with the bath water.  Sure he comes across as a bit arrogant, but he’s
that good.

The last question I often see is *Why is everyone paying Joel so much
attention?*  I addressed this very question before in my post, [What Is
It About Joel?](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/18/9543.aspx). 

![Rock
Star](http://www.chicagoist.com/attachments/chicagoist_julene/2006_03_rockstar.jpg)In
many respects, **Joel is the closest thing the software community has to
a bonafide rockstar**.  We’re half expecting to open up our aggregators
one day and read about him enrolling in a drug rehab program, but one of
those trendy ones in Malibu (or in the Hamptons I suppose with his
fondness for New York).  Like it or not, he’s opinionated, successful,
and a thought leader in our field.

So when he says something controversial, it’s natural to want to provide
a counter argument lest some young punk developer at your next team
meeting argues vehemently for writing a custom programming language and
uses an [Appeal to
Authority](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Appeal_to_authority) to make
his/her case.

Obviously what works for FogBugz does not work for everyone else, but
not understands that distinction.

In any case, this will be my last post on the subject of Joel. At least
until the cycle begins anew.
