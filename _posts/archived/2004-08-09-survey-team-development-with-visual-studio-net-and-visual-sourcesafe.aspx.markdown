![Patterns and Practices](/images/patternspractices.gif) I'm trying to
convince my coworkers that we should use the Isolated development mode
for ASP.NET projects as described in the Patterns and Practices document
[Team Development with Visual Studio .NET and Visual
SourceSafe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp).
They've agreed to read the document and we'll meet to discuss. I hope
the document convinces them, because I've had too many headaches in the
past dealing with FrontPage extensions.

My question to you all out there is do you set up your own development
environment according to the guidelines set out in this document? How is
it working for you or how have you changed it?
