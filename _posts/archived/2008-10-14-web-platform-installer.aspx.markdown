I’ve used the term “[drinking from the fire
hose](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/26/drinking-from-the-firehose.aspx "Drinking from the firehose")”
when describing my first days at Microsoft. However, I believe that a
lot of our customers feel this way when approaching the plethora of
options for web application development on the Microsoft stack.

This is feedback we’ve received from many sources and as Scott Hanselman
[pointed
out](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WebPlatformInstallerTryingToMakeItEasierToSetupForWebDevelopment.aspx "Hanselman on Web Platform Installer"),
there’s a concerted effort to make things easier to find and understand
here. Much of these efforts will take time to see fruition, but some of
them are happening now.

The new [Microsoft Web Platform Installer
Beta](http://www.microsoft.com/web/channel/products/WebPlatformInstaller.aspx "Microsoft Web Platform Installer Beta")
can get you up and running developing on ASP.NET in two easy clicks.

First, you select an option from the first screen. Obviously, if you
choose the *Your Choice* option, it’ll take more than two clicks.

[![choose-type](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/choose-type_thumb_1.png "choose-type")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/choose-type_4.png)

I chose the ASP.NET Developer option and clicked *Next*.

[![accept-license](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/accept-license_thumb_1.png "accept-license")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/accept-license_4.png)

The second screen lets you choose to accept the licensing terms. This is
nice in that you don’t have to go and click through 20 different EULAs.

Once you click *I Accept* the installer begins.

If you want more control, you can choose *Your Choice*at the first
screen which takes you to a screen that lets you choose all sorts of
options.

[![your-choice](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/your-choice_thumb.png "your-choice")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/WebPlatformInstaller_EA1C/your-choice_2.png)

This is a great tool for someone who wants to quickly get started
learning and developing on ASP.NET. You’ll notice that it doesn’t
include [ASP.NET MVC](http://asp.net/mvc "ASP.NET MVC Website") yet.
Don’t worry, it will once we have a proper beta release.

If you run into any problems with it, be sure to report it on [their
forums](http://forums.iis.net/1155.aspx "Web Platform Installer Forums").
For more information, be sure to read the [announcement on Bill Staple’s
blog](http://blogs.iis.net/bills/archive/2008/10/03/fast-download-and-install-of-microsoft-s-web-stack-iis7-asp-net-sql-express-and-visual-web-developer-and-more.aspx "Announcing").
