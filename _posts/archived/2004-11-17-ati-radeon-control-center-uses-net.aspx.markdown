![ATI Radeon](/images/AtiRadeon.jpg) I'm currently updating my device
driver for my ATI Radeon 9700 at work (I now have a new 17" LCD monitor
that supports portrait mode) and noticed that to install the CATALYST
Control Center, .NET 1.1 is required. See [for
yourself](http://www.ati.com/support/drivers/winxp/radeonwdm-xp.html?type=xp&prodType=graphic‚àè=productsXPdriver&submit.x=12&submit.y=2).

It's nice to see that .NET is starting to spread beyond internal
business applications, ASP.NET sites, and web services.
