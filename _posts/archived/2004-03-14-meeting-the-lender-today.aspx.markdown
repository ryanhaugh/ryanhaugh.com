We’re meeting the lender today to make the final preparations for the
big loan. I thought college was expensive, but this is on a whole
'nother level. For you out there who don’t live in California, I’m
basically buying a small 1000 sq ft 2 bedroom 2.5 bathroom condo
townhouse for probably the amount you could buy a mansion in Kentucky,
or a four bedroom house in Seattle. This market is crazy, but we're not
ready to leave L.A. just yet. So it's love it or buy it.
