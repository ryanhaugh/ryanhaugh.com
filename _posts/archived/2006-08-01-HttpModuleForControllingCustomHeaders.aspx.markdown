In a triumphant return after about three months of not blogging, [Barry
“idunno.org” Dorrans](http://idunno.org/ "Barry") has published an
[HttpModule for modifying custom HTTP
headers](http://idunno.org/displayBlog.aspx/2006080101 "HttpModule") in
response to a throw away comment by [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott The Hanselnator") in
[his post on P3P
requests](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/TheImportanceOfP3PAndACompactPrivacyPolicy.aspx "P3P Headers").

The nice thing about Barry’s module is that it is much widely general
and applicable than just for P3P headers.

So if you need tight control over your HTTP headers, this is the module
for you.
