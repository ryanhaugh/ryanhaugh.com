Apparently I’m not the only one to run into this annoying problem. When
using the HttpWebRequest to POST form data using HTTP 1.1, it ALWAYS
adds the following HTTP header "Expect: 100-Continue". Fixing the
problem has proved to be quite elusive.

According to the HTTP 1.1 protocol, when this header is sent, the form
data is not sent with the initial request. Instead, this header is sent
to the web server which responds with 100 (Continue) if implemented
correctly. However, not all web servers handle this correctly, including
the server to which I am attempting to post data. I sniffed the headers
that Internet Explorer sends and noticed that it does not send this
header, but my code does.

Looking through the newsgroups, several people have had problems with
this, but nobody with a solution (apart from going back to HTTP 1.0
which doesn’t work for me).

At this point, I thought I would fire up [Lutz
Roeder’s](http://www.aisto.com/roeder/dotnet/) Reflector 4.0 and look
through the source code for the System.Net.HttpWebRequest class. Aha!
There it is. Within a private method named "MakeRequest()" are the
following lines of code:

```csharp
if (this._ExpectContinue && ((this._HttpWriteMode == HttpWriteMode.Chunked) || (this._ContentLength > ((long) 0))))
{
    this._HttpRequestHeaders.AddInternal("Expect", "100-continue");
}
```

So even if you try to remove the Expect header from the
\_HttpRequestHeaders collection, the header will get added back when the
request is actually made.

Unfortunately, fixing this is not easy since MakeRequest is a private
method. Walking up the callee graph, I found that the method I would
have to override is BeginGetRequestStream (there are other ancestors
aside from this one). Unfortunately this method relies on several
internal and private objects to which I do not have access. I hoped to
re-use the existing code base and only make a slight tweak.

I even started down the path of building my own HttpWebRequest class
using the Rotor source code but ran into several problems there as well.

In any case, I think the easiest way to get this fixed is to find the
right person at Microsoft and ask them very nicely to try to get this in
SP2. Pretty Please?

UPDATE: [Lance Olson](http://blogs.msdn.com/lanceo/) points me to the
solution in my comments section. The `System.Net.ServicePointManager`
class has a static property named `Expect100Continue`. Setting this to
false will stop the header "Expect: 100-Continue" from being sent.
Thanks Lance!!!
