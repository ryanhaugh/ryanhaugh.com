Yes, THAT Hilary Rosen. The RIAA's former top attack dog Hilary Rosen is
[complaining about DRM on
music](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/archive/2005/05/steve-jobs-let-.html).
This is an interesting topic for her first post on Arianna Huffington's
[new blog](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/theblog/). Does she not realize
the inherent irony of her complaint?

[Listening to: Suedehead - Morrissey - Viva Hate (3:55)]
