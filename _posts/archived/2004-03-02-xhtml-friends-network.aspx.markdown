A while ago, I posted an
[entry](http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/archive/2004/02/18/201.aspx "Better Social Networking through Blogistry")
imagining the next generation of Rss Aggregators and blogging engines
that would in effect, create a better social network than Frienster,
Tribe, etc...

Looks like efforts were already under way. A
[commenter](http://rasterweb.net/raster/ "Commenter") pointed me to
[XFN](http://gmpg.org/xfn/ "XFN"), aka the XHTML Friends Network which
presents a simple way to express relationships through hyperlinks. Very
interesting.

After applying XFN tags, you can head over to
[http://www.rubhub.com](http://www.rubhub.com "Rub Hub - Relationship Lookup Engine")
and have them index your site. Entering a full or partial URL in their
search engine will bring up a relationship results page. This page lists
sites that link to the specified site and all the sites to which the
specified site links. With each link, the search results also dislay the
relationship (for example: Acquaintance).
