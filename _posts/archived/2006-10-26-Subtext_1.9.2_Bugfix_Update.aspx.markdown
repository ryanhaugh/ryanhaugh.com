As I mentioned in [my last
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/26/PATCH_Cannot_Delete_Posts_In_Subtext_1.9.2.aspx "Cannot Delete Posts"),
someone reported a bug with deleting posts in the admin tool.  That
posts also describes a quick and dirty workaround.

However, I fixed the bug and updated our current 1.9.2 release at
SourceForge.  The [existing URL to download the
release](https://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=137896&package_id=181920&release_id=458502 "Download Subtext 1.9.2")
is still valid.  The full version number for this release is
**1.9.2.23**.

To find out which version of Subtext you are running, just log into your
admin and look in the bottom left corner.  You should see the version
there.

Version](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/Subtext1.9.2BugfixUpdate_1064E/Subtext-VersionInfo%5B4%5D.png)

If you downloaded Subtext 1.9.2 before I applied the update, then you
will probably see version 1.9.2.19 in there.  If so, you have two
options.  You can either apply the [quick and dirty patch mentioned in
my last
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/26/PATCH_Cannot_Delete_Posts_In_Subtext_1.9.2.aspx "Quick and dirty patch"),
or you can download the latest build and update the
`Subtext.Framework.dll` file in the `bin` directory.

However, this latest update also includes some CSS fixes for the KeyWest
skin in IE 7 designed (and fixed) by [Robb
Allen](http://blog.robballen.com/ "Robb Allen").  So if you are using
that skin, you should download and apply this update.
