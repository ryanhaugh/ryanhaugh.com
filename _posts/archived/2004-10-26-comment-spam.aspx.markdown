![Spam](/images/Spam.jpg) [Adam](http://www.adamkinney.com/) tells me he
doesn't support comments nor the
[CommentAPI](http://wellformedweb.org/story/9 "CommentAPI") because he
doesn't want to deal with comment spam. So the day after admonishing him
for being anti-social, I get hit by a slew of comment spam pointing to
porn sites and selling Ginzu knifes. Did you know those things can cut
right through a can?

I removed the offensive comments. Don't worry, as a duty to my readers I
checked out the porn sites and you're not missing anything.

This torrent of comment spam means only one thing. I have arrived!
