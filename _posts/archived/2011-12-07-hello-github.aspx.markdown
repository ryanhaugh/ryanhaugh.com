*[Hubot](http://hubot.github.com/ "HuBot") stache me*.

Well the poll results are in and [you guys were very
close](http://haacked.uservoice.com/forums/141433-companies "Where will Phil go next?")!
I was taken aback at the intensity of the interest in where I would end
up. Seriously, I’m honored. But then I thought about it for a moment and
figured, *there must be a betting pool on this. These folks don’t care
that much*.

Today is my [first day as a GitHub
employee](https://github.com/blog/1002-phil-haack-is-a-githubber "Phil Haack is a GitHubber")!
In other words, I am now a *GitHubber*, a *Hubbernaut, a GitHubberati*.
Ok, I made that last one up.

If you haven’t heard of GitHub, it’s a site that makes it frictionless
to collaborate on code. Some would call it a source code hosting site,
or a forge, but it goes way beyond that. Their motto is “Social Coding”,
and they mean it. They’ve turned shipping software into a fun social
activity. It’s great!

Beyond a great product, they’ve built a great company culture. From
everything I’ve seen and read, GitHub has figured out how to make a
great work environment. They [optimize for
happiness](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/10/18/optimize-for-happiness.html "Optimize for happiness")
and I believe that’s resulted in a great product and a lot of success.
I’ll talk about that some more another time. For now, let’s talk about…

What will I be doing at GitHub?
-------------------------------

According to my offer letter, my title is “Windows Badass”, but the way
I see it, I will do whatever I can to help GitHub be even more awesome.
It’s going to take some creative thinking because it’s already pretty
damn cool, but I’ll figure something out.  My first idea for adding
[more cowbell](http://vimeo.com/14043123 "More Cowbell, on SNL") was
rejected, but I’m just finding my footing. I’ll get the hang of it.

More specifically, I plan to help GitHub appeal to more developers who
code for Windows and the .NET platform. For example, take a look at the
TIOBE language index.

[![tiobe-index](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Hello-GitHub_129E2/tiobe-index_thumb_1.png "tiobe-index")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Hello-GitHub_129E2/tiobe-index_4.png)

Now take a look at this chart from the [GitHub languages
page](https://github.com/languages "GitHub Languages Page").[![github
languages](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Hello-GitHub_129E2/github%20languages_thumb.png "github languages")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Hello-GitHub_129E2/github%20languages_2.png)

See something missing? Yes, oh mah gawd!
[LOLCODE](http://lolcode.com/ "Lolcode") is not there!!!

Ok, besides that. See something else missing? Despite the fact that
TIOBE ranks it as the fourth most popular language, C\# doesn’t make it
into the top ten at GitHub. I’d like to change that!

I’ve always been a big proponent of open source on .NET. Pretty much
everything I worked on at Microsoft was or became open source (*I did
work on a Web Form control that wasn’t open sourced, but we don’t talk
about that much*).

I will continue to work to grow a healthy open source ecosystem on .NET
and Windows. I hope to see more .NET developers contributing to open
source and doing it on GitHub.

This might include making the website more friendly to Windows
developers, working on a Windows client for GitHub, and continuing to
work on [NuGet](http://nuget.org/ "NuGet"), among other things. One of
the appealing aspects of GitHub to me was how much they *got* NuGet.
Perhaps more so than many at Microsoft.

Why Bother?
-----------

You might wonder, why bother?

Well, there’s the simple business answer. The more open source
developers there are, the more potential customers GitHub has. But we
have larger aspirations than that as well.

When trying to build a case for releasing more software as open source
at Microsoft, I once asked [Miguel de
Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel's Blog"), what’s in it for
Microsoft? Why do it?

His response was something along the lines of bla bla bla bla. But there
was one thing that he said that struck me.

> A rising tide lifts all boats.

When I first read that, I thought he wrote “tilde” and I was really
confused what a rising tilde had to do with anything.

But it makes sense to me now. As I wrote in a recent post talking about
software communities,

> The interchange of ideas between these disparate technology
> communities can only result in good things for everyone.

There are millions of .NET developers, but a disproportionately small
number of them are involved in open source projects. If we increase that
just a tiny bit, that increases the pool of ideas floating around in the
larger software community. Ideas backed by code that anybody can look
at, incorporate, tweak.

The nice thing here is I think a healthy .NET OSS ecosystem is a good
thing for everyone. Good for GitHub. Good for Microsoft. Good for the
software industry.

Am I moving?
------------

GitHub is located in an amazing space in San Francisco. When I visited,
Hubot pumped in Daft Punk via overhead speakers as people coded away.
That alone nearly sealed the deal for me. The fine scotch we sipped as
we talked about software didn’t hurt either.

But alas, as much as San Francisco is a great city, my family and I love
it here in the Washington, so I will work as a remote employee.
Fortunately, GitHub is well suited for remote employees. And this gives
me a great excuse to visit SF often!

My little octocats agree, this is a good thing.

If you’ve been a fan of my blog or Twitter account, I hope you stick
around. I’ll still be blogging about ASP.NET MVC, NuGet, etc. But you
can expect my blog will also expand to cover new topics.

It’ll be an adventure.
