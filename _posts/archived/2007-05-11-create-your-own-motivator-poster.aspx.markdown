[This tool is really
cool](http://bighugelabs.com/flickr/motivator.php "Motivator Poster").
It’s a tool used to make those cheesy Motivator posters. Or, go to [this
tool](http://diy.despair.com/motivator.php "Demotivator") and make a
Demotivator poster.

Here are two posters I made.

[![Admiration - Respect is good. But your Man Crush is starting to freak
him
out.](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreateYourOwnMotivatorPoster_AA0E/Motivator_thumb1.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreateYourOwnMotivatorPoster_AA0E/Motivator3.jpg "Admiration")

[![Persistence - A sunny spot is hard to
find](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreateYourOwnMotivatorPoster_AA0E/Persistence_thumb.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/CreateYourOwnMotivatorPoster_AA0E/Persistence2.jpg "Persistence")
