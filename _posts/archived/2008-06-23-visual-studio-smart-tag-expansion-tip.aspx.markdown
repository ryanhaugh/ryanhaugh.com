I used to find the smart tag really annoying in Visual Studio because it
is such a small target to hit with the mouse. Silly me, trying to expand
a smart tag with a mouse.

When you highlight the tag with your mouse, it tells you that the
keyboard combination of ALT + SHIFT + F10 will expand the menu.

What it doesn’t tell you is that there’s a two key combination that will
also expand it. I learned this one from [Karen
Liu](http://blogs.msdn.com/karenliu/ "Karen Liu's Blog") of the C\# IDE
team who also happens to have a blog post with [a nice collection of
other tips and
tricks](http://blogs.msdn.com/karenliu/archive/2007/06/21/tips-and-tricks-for-vs20005-and-vs2008.aspx "Tips and Tricks for VS2005")
written last year.

Just hit the CTRL key plus the period key (CTRL + .)

I really like this approach when performing renames within Visual Studio
because it’s totally contextual. Rather than starting with a rename
refactoring, I can instead just start renaming something and the smart
tag shows up and all I have to do is hit CTRL + . and then ENTER.
Booyah!
