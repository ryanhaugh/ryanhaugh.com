[Scott Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/) provides an [excellent
writeup](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,b6603ac5-3464-490f-a557-62f56b7f5668.aspx)
of how to use GNU Patch.exe with CVS and DIFF files. This is very
helpful as it is the one (of perhaps many) thing missing from my
[Quickstart Guide to CVS and
SourceForge](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/12/3178.aspx) for
Windows developers.

When I get a free moment, I will update my Quickstart.
