Note that in the same vein as Pele, Ronaldinho and Ronaldo, Joel has
reach that Brazillian Soccer player level of stardom in the geek
community and can pretty much go by just his first name. Admit it, you
knew who I was referring to in the title. Admit it!*

Please indulge me in a brief moment of hubris.

I was reading part 1 of [Joel Spolsky’s talk at
Yale](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2007/12/03.html "Joel's Talk at Yale Part 1")
that he gave on November 28 and came upon this quote on code
provability...

Hey, that sounds familiar! By coincidence, [I wrote the
following](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/11/16/what-exactly-are-you-trying-to-prove.aspx "What exactly are you trying to prove")
on November 16^th^,12 days prior to Joel’s talk...

Sure, it isn’t exactly an original thought, but the timing seemed too
coincidental. Could it really be? Could my post inspired one small point
in a talk given by someone of his stature?

For a moment, I allowed myself to dream like a true fanboy that Mr. Joel
really did read my blog. Until I read this (cue sound of pots and pans
crashing down)...

Crestfallen, I realized Mr. Joel indeed did not read my post, in which I
claimed...

To be fair, I wouldn’t call Joel a major TDD proponent, but I hoped he
would understand that TDD is about improving the design of code and also
providing *confidence* to make changes to the system. It’s no proof of
correctness, but can be a proof of incorrectness when a test fails.

Oh well, one can dream.
