If ever someone was undeserving of having others spend their valuable
time translating his blog, it would be me. But hey, some people from the
[http://blog.joycode.com/](http://blog.joycode.com/ "Blog Joycode") site
went ahead and [did it
anyway](http://blog.joycode.com/haacked/ "My blog in Chinese"). I must
admit that I’m very flattered that anyone would put the effort in.

Before this, I learned that [Subtext powers
MySpace](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/10/29/subtext-powers-myspace-china-blogs.aspx "Subtext powers china")
China's blogs, and now my blog is translated to Chinese. As David
Hasselhoff says, “I’m big in China”. (*To my Chinese audience, that is a
joke. I am quite small.*)
