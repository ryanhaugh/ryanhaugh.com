I recently added a [Privacy
Policy](http://haacked.com/articles/1095.aspx) for this site to the top
navigation bar. I did this after reading this [blog
post](http://www.kbcafe.com/iBLOGthere4iM/?guid=20040901191359). Having
a privacy policy is one of the conditions for the [iTunes affiliate
program](http://www.apple.com/itunes/affiliates/).

I have yet to run this by a lawyer. Walt, Dan. Have I adequately covered
my ass?
