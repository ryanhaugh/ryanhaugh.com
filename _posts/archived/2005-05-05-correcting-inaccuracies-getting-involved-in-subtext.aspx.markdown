![Tentative logo](/images/header_logo.gif) [Ken
Robertson](http://www.qgyen.net/blog/) points out some [minor
inaccuracies](http://www.qgyen.net/blog/archive/2005/05/05/1024.aspx)
(none intentional) in [my
announcement](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/2953.aspx) about
Subtext concerning Community Server.

I went ahead and made some [corrections in the
announcement](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/04/2953.aspx), though I
defended my point about targeting different markets which I will repeat
here.

> As for the target market, I see your point that I may be slightly off.
> My point is that by commercializing Community Server, you've created
> an incentive to target the needs of larger paying corporations. You're
> a business and you need the cash inflow. Nothing wrong with that.

I also go on to mention in my update to the announcement

> Starting this project is not an attack of Telligent or Community
> Server by any means. I do wish them well. I just think there's still
> room for a tightly focused Open Source blogging engine targeted to
> individuals with no restrictions. It's very likely that Community
> Server 1.1 or 1.2 will blow our socks off and have us questioning

Only time will tell if I'm proven wrong or not. In the mean time, we
have a team of people really amped about this project. It will be a fun
experiment whatever happens.
