![TRS 80 Color Computer](/images/Trs80ColorComputer.jpg) Via [Rory’s
post here](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/14587.aspx), I’ve discovered
the [Obsolete Technology Website](http://oldcomputers.net/index.html).

The fact that this site evokes nostalgia only reinforces two facts about
me, that I am a total geek and I’m getting old. I love the
[write-up](http://oldcomputers.net/coco.html) of my very first computer
(which I still own and have laying around here somewhere).

Ahhh yeah!

![Commodore 128](/images/Commodore128.jpg)Later, when several of my
friends were riding the Commodore 64 wave, I jumped one step ahead with
my second computer, the [Commodore
128](http://oldcomputers.net/c128d.html) (one-piece model). In sense,
this wasn’t a step ahead at all as the Commodore 128 was just a
glorified Commodore 64 with a nicer looking case. Just about nobody
jumped at the chance to write software that took advantage of the C128
Mode or the CP/M mode. I pretty much spent most of the time using it in
C64 mode.

![Amiga 500](/images/Commodore128.jpg) My third, and last computer
before switching over to the Wintel universe, was every geek boy’s wet
dream at the time, the Amiga 500. Unfortunately the site doesn’t have a
write-up of the Amiga 500 specifically, but you can read up on the
[Amiga 2000](http://oldcomputers.net/amiga2000.html) which came out the
same year.

Ahhh memories...

*UPDATE 2013-06-24: Turns out I still have that TRS-80!*
