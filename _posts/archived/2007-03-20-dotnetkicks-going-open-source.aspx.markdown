[Gavin Joyce](http://weblogs.asp.net/gavinjoyce/ "Gavin Joyce"), creator
of [DotNetKicks](http://dotnetkicks.com/ "DotNetKicks"), has decided to
[open the source for the
site](http://weblogs.asp.net/gavinjoyce/archive/2007/03/20/dotnetkicks-to-be-open-source.aspx "DotNetKicks To Be Open Sourced")
and allow the community to help out in implemeting features and bug
fixes.

This makes a lot of sense for a community site like DotNetKicks. Not
only can the community build the content, but it can contribute to the
actual feature set of the site as well!

Gavin has always been a bit progressive with this site, offering [half
of his AdSense
revenue](http://www.dotnetkicks.com/docs/earnmoney "Earn Advertising Revenue with DotNetKicks")
to those who submit stories (you have to configure your AdSense in your
profile and DotNetKicks will show your AdSense ID 50% of the time).

I think this is a great idea and wish him much luck. I also look forward
to being able to contribute a little bit here and there (donating
heavily with code from
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") of
course).
