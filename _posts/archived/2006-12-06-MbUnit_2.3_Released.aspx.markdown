My favorite unit testing framework just released a new version. [Andrew
Stopford](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/ "Andrew Stopford's blog")
has [the announcement
here](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/archive/2006/12/07/mbunit-2-3-rtm.aspx?CommentPosted=true#commentmessage "MbUnit Announcement") and
you can download the release from [the MbUnit
site](http://www.mbunit.com/ "MbUnit.com").

I met Andrew at Mix 06 early this year and he’s a class act and great
project lead. I’ve been following MbUnit’s progress on and off and am
really happy with the team’s responsiveness to my submitted issues.

My one tiny contribution to the project was to [purchase the mbunit.com
domain](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/06/05/IntroducingMBUnit.com.aspx "Introducing MbUnit.com")
for them. Perhaps a little bribe to get my feature requests looked at
promptly. ;)

If you are wondering why I prefe MbUnit of NUnit, check out these posts:
