Perhaps I have a skewed view of reality, but I get the impression that
software geeks are leading the charge into building the next generation
of social software. Does it strike anyone else as odd that nerds are the
ones defining the technologies and interfaces for people to become
**social**? Is this some sort of *[Revenge of the
Nerds](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088000/)* we plan to inflict on the
“cool” social butterflies who spurned us in our youth?

Maybe they are not so visible, but I would expect to see the technology
leaders pushing the social software revolution to publicize their top
notch sociologists alongside their technologists. Hey, we love your
tech-guy’s fantastical AJAX framework, but is it really fostering social
networking and community growth? How are you measuring that? Where is
your Chief Sociologist Architect?
