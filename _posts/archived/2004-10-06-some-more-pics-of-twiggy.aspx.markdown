So Twiggy's a fast learner. She now knows that the proper place to do
her thing is outside and not in the house. She even knows to whine if
she needs to go so. The vet removed her stitches and she has an
appointment to get spayed soon. We're a little worried about it as we
hear it can be a difficult operation, but I'm sure she'll do fine.

She's also a friendly dog. She scared this poor chihauha puppy by trying
to run up to it and greet it. The only time Twiggy barks is when she can
hear a dog nearby and wants to play.

We're waiting for some sweaters and a parka we ordered for her. She's
all skin and bones and we hope to take her along when we visit my folks
in Alaska for Christmas.

In any case, we're doing all we can to provide her with a good home and
she seems happy for it. She never comes to me when I call her to, but
the instant I sit on a couch, she shows us her true speed with a mad
dash and a hop by my side.

The next step for Twiggy is to start her off on some elementary topics
in OO design and hopefully progress to an understanding of how to build
enterprise systems using the .NET platform. The expense is getting to
the point that she needs to earn her keep. Besides, I hope this to be a
technical blog and she should be providing content. Her first assignment
is to provide an overview of generics in .NET 2.0. Good girl! Good girl!
