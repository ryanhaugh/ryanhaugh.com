It only feels like yesterday that [we shipped ASP.NET MVC
3](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/13/aspnetmvc3-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 and NuGet 1.0 released")
followed by a release of [updated Visual Studio
tooling](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/04/12/introducing-asp-net-mvc-3-tools-update.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update")
for ASP.NET MVC 3. But we’re not ones to sit on our hands for long and
are busy at work on ASP.NET MVC 4.

In fact, almost immediately after shipping ASP.NET MVC 3, we started
working through our backlog of bugs at the same time that we started
general planning for the next major version.

Today, I’ve published the result of that planning in the form of a
**[high-level roadmap for ASP.NET MVC
4](http://aspnet.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=ASP.NET%20MVC%204%20RoadMap "ASP.NET MVC 4 Roadmap")**.

There’s an important disclaimer I want to highlight in the roadmap:

> It’s important to understand that we are in **the early stages**of
> development on ASP.NET MVC 4 and that this roadmap is a planning
> document for the next release. It is not a specification of what is to

> but there are no guarantees. **Plans can change. And you can help
> change them!** Please visit [our

This roadmap is more detailed than roadmaps that we’ve written in the
past. My hope is that it provides enough of a taste of the features to
come that we can get feedback even earlier on features that we have yet
to implement.

One of the cool new features I want to highlight is the feature we’re
calling “Recipes”. In brief, a recipe is scaffolding on steroids. These
are bits of UI delivered via NuGet for accomplishing common tasks. We
put a few ideas in the roadmap, but would love to hear more ideas.

**Not included** in the roadmap are the many cool enhancements to Razor
and other features being considered for the next version of ASP.NET Web
Pages that ASP.NET MVC developers will get for free! [Erik
Porter](http://erikporter.com/ "Erik Porter's Blog") (aka
@humancompiler) and his team are hard at work on those features, so I
won’t spoil the surprise.

UPDATE: We started a UserVoice site for [ASP.NET MVC
features](http://aspnet.uservoice.com/forums/41201-asp-net-mvc).
