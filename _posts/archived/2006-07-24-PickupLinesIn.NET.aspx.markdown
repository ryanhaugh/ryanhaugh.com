Now this is the ultimate in geekery. [K. Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/ "Ode To Code") posts [pickup
lines in
.NET](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/comments/5403.aspx "Pickup Lines").

Now is this really necessary? Don’t geeks have enough troubles with the
ladies without these serious groaners to encourage them?

So naturally, I must respond with my own groaners. Warning, not safe for
... well really anyone who enjoys humor that is actually humorous.

-   You can handle my event any time
-   What’s your sign? I’m unsigned and I do byte. Rowr.
-   I’d like to get `Interlocked` with you and see what increments.
-   Them hips must be *newing* up objects real fast because you are
    putting pressure on my heap.
-   The moment I saw you I nearly overflowed my stack.
-   Care to reference my private member?
-   You Auto-Complete Me.

Update: My favorite comment so far on these groaners comes from [Sahil
Malik](http://winsmarts.com/ "Sahil") over on [Scott’s
blog](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/ "Ode To Code").

My response is that these are not for us geeks. It is for those who wish
to land a geek.
