Last night I got a little treat in the mail from the [kind folks at
StickerMule](http://stickermule.com/ "StickerMule"). I really appreciate
how they [support open source
projects](http://lozanotek.com/blog/archive/2010/08/05/open_source_support_is_not_just_code.aspx "Open Source support is not just code")
with such great stickers.

*Look at all those little NuGets!*

Just in time as I have a few events I’ll be going to where I can hand
some out such as [Web Camps
Argentina/Brazil](http://haacked.com/archive/2010/12/21/see-me-in-brazil-and-argentina-in-march.aspx "Web Camps Argentina/Brazil"),
the MVP Summit, and if I’m selected, Mix 2011.

After that, I need to figure out the best way to give the rest out since
I won’t be travelling a whole lot this year. We’ll need to have a [Nerd
Dinner](http://nerddinner.com/ "Nerd Dinner") or something. I’ll give
some to [Scott Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/ "Scott Hanselman") since
he travels a lot too.
