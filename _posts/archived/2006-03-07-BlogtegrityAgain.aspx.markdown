[Scott over at LazyCoder](http://www.lazycoder.com/ "Lazy Coder Blog")
called me out in my comments for [participating in Channel 9’s viral
marketing](/archive/2006/03/06/BeyondChannel9.aspx "Am I Being Used?")
campaign for [On10.net](http://on10.net/ "On 10"), whatever that may be.

I have never met Scott in person, yet he challenges me about this. And
this is exactly what I love about the ~~blogosphere~~^1^ .NET blogging
community. That despite never meeting, it really does feel like a
community in which we know each other well enough through our writings
and feel empowered to challenge each other if need be.

On his blog, he writes (and my ego leads me to believe this is a
response to my post) [a promise
statement](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/index.php/archives/2006/03/07/a-promise/ "A Promise")
that everything he says will be genuine. This is a statement of his
blog’s integrity or **blogtegrity** for short (sorry, but I like making
up words). Think of blogtegrity as being kind of like journalistic
integrity, but with much more integrity to the truth and not beholden to
the government or large corporate interests (ooooh, I went there).

I love this and it gave me an idea to take it to the next step. For a
while now on the top navigation of my blog I have had a link to my
[privacy
statement](http://haacked.com/articles/PrivacyPolicy.aspx "Privacy Statement").
I have now added a [link to my blogtegrity
statement](/articles/blogtegrity "Blogtegrity"). It is a promise
similar to Scott’s that I will maintain my Blogtegrity to the best of my
ability.

As for me being a Microsoft Shill, here was my response...

> I have a couple of friends I know personally (I knew them before they
> were assimilated into the borg) that work there who are very excited
> about the work they've been doing and told me about this, but couldn't
> give me details.
>
> This is just friends helping friends. I trust their judgement.

In a follow-up I mentioned

> Ha ha. Oh ye of little faith.
>
> Scott, after writing this post ([Better Developers Through
> Diversity](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/02/16/BetterDevelopersThroughDiversity.aspx "Diversity Post"))
> critical of "Microsoft-Think" you'd still think I might be a Microsoft
> Shill? ;)

Till next time, Goodnight and Goodluck.

^1^ Apparently it is no [longer de rigueur to use the term
"blogosphere"](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/PermaLink.aspx?guid=7da2851c-f9aa-448d-9d04-ba89583ac388 "Blogosphere is a stupid word").
I have never personally had a problem with the word, despite the fact
that it is ill-defined. The term “architecture” is ill defined as well
but useful in discussing software.

How many words describing a community *are* well defined?

Meaning of words are hardly ever set in stone, they are an ongoing
negotiation. Much like grammar. Otherwise meaning would never change to
fit the changing context in which we live.
