Today on Twitter, I noticed this tweet from [Dare
Obasanjo](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ "Dare Obasanjo") (aka
[@carnage4life](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life "Carnage4Life on Twitter")
on Twitter) critical of a blog post by [Rand
Fishkin](http://moz.com/rand/ "Rand Fishkin's Blog"), co-founder and CEO
of [SEOMoz](http://seomoz.com/ "SEOMoz").

Dare is one of those folks who is very thoughtful in what he blogs and
tweets. Most of what he posts is worthwhile, so naturally I clicked
through and [read the
post](http://moz.com/rand/one-bad-policy-change-email-can-kill-company-culture/ "How company policy can kill company culture").
In the post, Rand poses a hypothetical scenario (emphasis mine):

> For example, let’s say Company X has been having trouble with abuse of
> work-from-home privileges. Managers are finding that **more and more
> people are getting less accomplished and a primary suspect is a lack
> of coming into the office\***. The problem is circulated at the
> executive team meeting and a decision is made to change the
> work-from-home policy to provide greater analytics and visibility. An
> email is sent to the team that looks like this:

Rand supplies the “typical” corporate response:

> *To: Allhands@CompanyX.com* \
> *From: JoeTheHRManager@CompanyX.com* \
> *Subject: New Work-From-Home Policy*
>
> *Hi Everyone,*
>
> *Starting next week, we’re making a change in policy around time
> working out of the office. Employees wishing to work from home must
> send an explanatory writeup to their manager. It will be at managers’
> discretion whether these requests will be accepted.*
>
> *If you have feedback, please email HR@CompanyX.com*
>
> *Thanks very much,*
>
> *Joe*

And here’s his “improved” response. To be fair, he makes it clear that
he doesn’t think it’s perfect and he’d spend more time on it if he were
actually sending such mail.

> *To: Allhands@CompanyX.com* \
> *From: RandtheCEO@CompanyX.com* \

The Golden Rule
---------------

Before I comment, I should point out that while I have managed some poor
souls in the distant past, I’ve never been a CEO or an HR director. I
don’t have years of experience in those fields.

But I do have years of experience being an employee. This makes me
especially qualified to critique these emails. Let’s face it. They
absolutely *reek* of manager speak.

I’ve had great managers in the past, but there’s one common trait I’ve
noticed from many managers. They’re typically self-centered and frame
everything from their scope of influence.

The email could be made so much better by practicing a very simple
thing. **Put yourself in the audience’s shoes.**In other words, practice
the [Golden
Rule](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_Rule "The Golden Rule"). How
would *you* react to such an email if the tables were turned and you
were the employee and you got this email from management?

I’d imagine you’d prefer to be spoken to as a peer and an adult, not as
child who needs to be controlled. These emails feel like classic
examples of “Theory Y” as Dan Ostlund highlighted in his FogCreek blog
post, [Why do we pay sales
commissions](http://blog.fogcreek.com/why-do-we-pay-sales-commissions/ "Why do we pay sales commissions")
where he addresses the dual theories on how management views workers:

> The tension between these views of workers was described in the 1960s
> by Douglas MacGregor in his book [The Human Side of
> Enterprise](http://www.amazon.com/Human-Side-Enterprise-Annotated/dp/0071462228/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1325694254&sr=8-1).
> He suggested that managers had two views of motivation, and that a
> manager’s theory of motivation determined company culture. The first
> view he called Theory X which assumes that people are lazy, want to
> avoid work and need to be controlled, coerced, punished, and lavishly
> rewarded in order to perform. Sounds like some sort of S&M dungeon to
> me. Theory X demands a lot of managerial control and tends to
> demotivate, generate hostility, and generally make people into sour
> pusses.
>
> The second he called Theory Y which assumes that people are
> self-motivated, derive satisfaction from their work, are creative, and
> thrive when given autonomy.

As you can tell, I strongly subscribe to Theory Y. Perhaps if I *was* a
CEO, I’d change my mind and subscribe to Theory X in a sadistic desire
to exert my will over others. Perhaps using a bullwhip.

But I’m not. I’m an employee and I like being treated like an adult. I’m
very fortunate to work at a place that is so camped out in Theory Y it’s
crazy.

If you do have employees who act like children and only respond to
command and control, maybe it’s time to get rid of them.

Attack the Root Problem
-----------------------

So back to these emails. Putting myself in the employee’s shoes, here’s
how I might react to them.

If I were working from home productively, I’d be annoyed by the fact
that more process is being added to my work day due to the lack of
productivity of others.

But maybe I’m one of the people whose productivity has declined. Well
I’d probably still be annoyed because the letter misses the point and
doesn’t address the real problem.

Note that in the original scenario, I put some emphasis on a phrase:

> **more and more people are getting less accomplished and a primary
> suspect is a lack of coming into the office\***.

Both of the proposed responses immediately commit a logical fallacy. Now
please, repeat after me: **correlation does not imply causation**!

**The problem is not that people are working from home. The problem is
the decline in productivity!**

Working from home is only a potential suspect as the cause in this
decline. But management runs with this and puts more constraints in
place that only serve to annoy employees. That’s putting a band-aid on a
problem *they admit they don’t yet understand!*

The solution is to attack the root problem. Find out what the real cause
is and enlist the help of your employees to solve the issue. If I were
sending out the email, I’d probably start by sending it to just the
managers first (this assumes my company even has managers in the first
place):

> *To: Overhead
> \<[managers@CompanyX.com](mailto:managers@CompanyX.com)\>* \
> *From:
> [HaackTheAllPowerfulCEO@CompanyX.com](mailto:HaackTheAllPowerfulCEO@CompanyX.com)*
> \
> *Subject: Productivity & Working Out of Office*
>
> *Hi Everyone,*
>
> *Over the last month, several managers have been concerned about our
> ability to get collaboration-dependent projects completed. We need to
> better understand the root cause of why our productivity has
> declined.*
>
> *I recommend talking to your reports, clearly state the problem, and
> gather their ideas on how we can improve overall collaboration and
> productivity. I’m especially interested in what we can do as
> management to remove any roadblocks that prevent them from being as
> productive as they’d like.*
>
> *If you’ve got any feedback, ideas or feel that we’re being
> knuckleheads and missing the real problem, please talk to me!*
>
> *Also, whoever used the executive bathroom last, please light a candle
> next time.*
>
> *Thanks gang,*
>
> *Phil*

You just might find out that the reason Fred’s productivity declined is
because he has a sick child at home and needs to be able to help out at
home during the day. But because your company’s culture is so focused on
synchronous collaboration, he can’t really make up the work at night.
Asking Fred to come into work more often doesn’t solve anything. But
improving your collaboration tools and helping foster a culture that can
thrive with [asynchronous
communication](http://zachholman.com/posts/how-github-works-asynchronous/ "Asynchronous communication")
just might!

Strike at the root problem my friends and treat each other with respect.
That’s how you talk to employees (*and ideally, everyone*).
