In my last post, I presented [a general overview of the CodePlex
foundation](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/09/11/codeplex-foundation.aspx "What the CodePlex Foundation Means to the .NET OSS Developer")
and talked a bit about what it means to the .NET OSS developer,
admittedly without much in the way of details. I plan to fix some of
that in this post.

Before I continue, I encourage you to read [Scott Bellware’s great
analysis](http://blog.scottbellware.com/2009/09/analysis-codeplex-foundation-terms-of.html "CodePlex Foundation - The Terms of Mutual Surrender")
of the CodePlex foundation which covers some of the points I planned to
make (making my life easier). It’s a must-read to better understand the
potential and opportunity presented by the foundation.

There’s one particular point he makes which I’d like to expound upon.

> The CodePlex Foundation will bring influential open source projects
> under its auspices. The details aren't clear yet, but it's reasonable
> to assume that the foundation will support its projects the way that
> other software foundations support their projects, with protection for
> these projects as they are used in corporate and commercial contexts

> deal.

I talked to [Bill
Staples](http://blogs.iis.net/bills/default.aspx "Bill Staples")
recently and he pointed out that The Apache Foundation is one source
(among many) of inspiration for the CodePlex Foundation. If you go to
the Apache FAQ, you’ll find the answer to the following question, “[How
does the ASF help its
projects](http://www.apache.org/foundation/faq.html#how "How does the ASF help its projects?")?”
(emphasis mine)

> As a corporate entity, the Apache Software Foundation is able to be a
> party to contracts, such as for technical services or guarantee-bonds
> for conferences. It can also accept donations on behalf of its
> projects, clarifying the associated tax issues, and create additional
> self-funded services via community-building activities, such as
> Apache-related T-shirts and user conferences.
>
> **In addition, the Foundation provides a framework for limiting the
> legal exposure of individual volunteers while they work on behalf of
> one of the ASF projects. In the past, these volunteers have been
> personally vulnerable to lawsuits, whether legitimate or frivolous,
> which impaired many activities that might have significantly improved
> contributions to the projects and benefited our users.**

The first paragraph is what I alluded to in my last post, and this is
something that the CodePlex Foundation would like to do in the long run,
but as I mentioned before, it all depends on the level of participation
and sponsorship funding. In an ideal world, the foundation would be able
to add some level of funding of projects to this list of benefits for a
member project.

The second paragraph is something that the CodePlex Foundation
definitely wants to do right off the bat.

This is great news for those of us hosting open source projects. It’s
generally not a worry for many small .NET open source projects, but the
risk is always there that if a project starts to get noticed, some
company may come along and sue the project owner for patent infringement
etc. Typical projects may not have any money to go after, but I can
imagine a commercial company going after a competing OSS product simply
to shutter it.

Assigning your project’s copyright to the CodePlex Foundation would
afford some level of legal protection against this sort of thing,
similar to the way it works with the Apache Foundation.

One nice thing about the CodePlex Foundation is you have the option to
assign copyright to the foundation or license your code to the
foundation. I’m not a lawyer so I don’t understand if one provides more
legal protection than the other. Honestly, once the foundation starts
accepting projects at large, I would want to assign Subtext’s copyright
over so that my name doesn’t appear as the big red bulls-eye in the
Subtext copyright notice! ;)

And if you’re wondering, “*am I losing control over my project by
assigning copyright over”*you are not. As I wrote in my post [Who Owns
The Copyright For An Open Source
Project](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/26/WhoOwnstheCopyrightforAnOpenSourceProject.aspx "Who Owns The Copyright on an Open Source Project")
(part of my series called the [Developer’s Guide To Copyright
Law](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/TheDevelopersGuideToCopyrightLaw-Part1.aspx "Developer's Guide To Copyright Law"))
you’d be assigning it under the **open source license of your choice**
(*yes, the CodePlex Foundation is more or less license agnostic. It
doesn’t require a specific license to join*), which always gives you the
freedom to fork it should the foundation suddenly be overtaken by evil
Ninjas.

As I said before, many of these details are still being hashed out and
I’m guessing some of them won’t be finalized until the final board of
directors is in place. But in the meanwhile, I think understanding the
sources of inspiration for this new foundation will help provide insight
into the direction it may take.

I hope this provides more concrete details than my last post.
