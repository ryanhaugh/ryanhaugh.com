This is part 1 in a three-part series on copyright law and open source
licensing. After this, continue onto [Part
2](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/DevelopersGuideToOpenSourceSoftwareLicensing.aspx "Part 2 of the series")
and [Part
3](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/25/WhoOwnstheCopyrightforAnOpenSourceProject.aspx)
of the series.

### Disclaimer

![Book
Cover](http://haacked.com/images/UnderstandingOpenSourceLicensing.gif)
As is customary when a non-lawyer attempts to discuss the finer points
of the law, I must start with a disclaimer. I know some fine lawyers,
but I, sir, am not a lawyer. So please do not consider this to be legal
advice. It is merely a rough primer on copyright law as it pertains to
software based on my readings and conversations. If you need specific
legal advice, talk to your own damn lawyer.

### Intro

After finishing the Fogel book, “[Producing Open Source
Software](http://producingoss.com/)”, I followed up by reading
“[Understanding Open Source and Free Software
Licensing](http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/osfreesoft/book/ "Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing Book Online")”
by Andrew M. St. Laurent.

This book combined with previous readings serves as the inspiration and
source for this series. I will focus on the issues pertinent to software
developers who wish to get involved in open source development. For a
more complete treatment of the topics, I recommend reading the books
mentioned.

In this first post in this series, I will discuss the basics of
copyright law. This will set the stage for part 2 in which I will
discuss software licensing.

### Basics of Copyright

In countries that support the [Berne
Convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention "Berne Convention"),
as soon as you set pen to paper, brush to canvas, or fingers to that
dirty keyboard, the work you create is automatically afforded protection
by copyright law. This assumes that your creation is not itself
infringing on another’s copyright such as plagiarism. Also, there must
be a small degree of creativity in the work. For example, you cannot
simply jot down and copyright names copied from a phone book. Additional
copyright protection is available through registration with the
copyright office, but registration is not required.

Note that copyright applies to a particular expression of an idea, not
to the idea itself. You can copyright a specific drawing of a penguin,
but your copyright does not apply to drawings of penguins in general.
Trademarks and patents are used to provide legal protections for
concepts, ideas, facts outside of the scope of copyright law, but that
is a topic out of scope for this post.

### The Rights of Copyright

So exactly what rights do you have to copyrighted works? Well the
obvious right is the right to copy. A copyright gives the owner full and
exclusive rights to control who may copy or create a derivative of a
work and how that may be done. As a copyright owner, you may state that
nobody is allowed to copy or make derivative versions of your work
(though the doctrine of “[fair
use](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_use "Wikipedia definition of 'Fair Use'")”
allows some non-infringing uses such as quoting from the work in a book
review). A copyright gives the owner exclusive rights to a work, but
this protection does not last forever.

If someone were to infringe on your copyright, you have the right to sue
for damages, but this requires that you prove a loss occurred due to the
infringement, which can be difficult. You may receive additional
copyright protection by registering the work with the copyright office.
For example, you can get “statutory damages”, compensation fixed by law
that does not require proving an actual loss.

### Who Owns Your Code?

Therefore you own the copyright to every line of code you write. Well...
sort of.

The code a developer writes while an employee or client fall under the
doctrine of “work for hire” and therefore belong to the employer (or
client). Some independent contractors will stipulate in their service
agreement with the client that even though the client owns the copyright
to the code, the client shall give the contractor a non-exclusive
license to the code.

### Next Time: Licensing

In the [next post in this
series](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/DevelopersGuideToOpenSourceSoftwareLicensing.aspx),
I will discuss licensing and get into the nitty gritty as it pertains to
open source software. Many thanks to my friend Walter Impert for his
legal editing.
