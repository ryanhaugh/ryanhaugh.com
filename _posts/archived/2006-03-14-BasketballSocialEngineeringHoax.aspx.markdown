about a humorous, cruel, yet very clever social engineering hoax
inflicted on a USC basketball player in the lead up to an important
game.

Apparently the ruse worked, the player, Gabe Pruitt, put up a [miserable
3-for-13 game from the
field](http://rangelife.typepad.com/rangelife/2006/03/victoria_not_vi.html "Cruel Victoria").

Here is a shot of Pruitt as he realizes heâ€™s been owned.

I feel for the guy.
