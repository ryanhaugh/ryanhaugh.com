![Margaret Cho Revolution](/images/Margaret.jpg)We recently saw Margaret
Cho try out some new material in Claremont. I think she's absolutely
hilarious and poignant. Some say she relies way too much on her Korean
mother, but having a Korean mother myself, I think she's spot on with
the impression.

I'm looking forward to seeing her next big movie *Revolution*. Here's a
nice [review](http://slate.msn.com/id/2102645/fr/rss/) from
[Slate.com](http://slate.msn.com/).
