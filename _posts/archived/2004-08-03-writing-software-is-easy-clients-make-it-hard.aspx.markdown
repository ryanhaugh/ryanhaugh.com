[Patrick Cauldwell](http://www.cauldwell.net/patrick/blog/) points out
that the challenge of coding a business app isn’t in writing the code,
that’s easy. The challenge is in understanding business requirements,
and not because developers and architects can’t understand plain
English.

In my experience, I find that often, “business people” (for the lack of
a better word) do not apply the same rigor to developing a business
model for an application as developers do towards requirements
gathering, specifications, and coding for the application.

I understand that agile methodologies are designed to help manage
change, but even they can’t keep up when the business owner doesn’t even
know what the requirements should be, but is spouting them out anyways.
What do you do when the business owner has been involved in every step
of the project, played with every prototype and interim release, but at
the end says, well that’s not what I want.

As a developer friend of mine used to say,

> This job would be great if we didn’t have clients.

Of course I prefer the paycheck.
