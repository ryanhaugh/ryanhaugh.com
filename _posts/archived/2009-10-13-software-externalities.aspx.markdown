If you’re a manufacturing plant, one way to maximize profit is to keep
costs as low as possible. One way to do that is to cut corners. Go ahead
and dump that toxic waste into the river and pollute the heck out of the
air with your smoke stacks. These options are much cheaper than
installing smoke scrubbers or trucking waste to proper disposal sites.

Of course, economists have long known that this does not paint the
entire picture. Taking these shortcuts incur other costs, it’s just that
these costs are not borne by the manufacturing plant. The term
[externalities](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Externality "Externalities on Wikipedia")
describes such spillover costs.

> In economics an externality or spillover of an economic transaction is
> an impact on a party that is not directly involved in the transaction.
> In such a case, prices do not reflect the full costs or benefits in
> production or consumption of a product or service.

Thus the full cost of manufacturing includes the hospital bills of those
who get sick by drinking the tainted water, the cost of the crops
damaged by the acid rain, etc.

Software is the same way. I got to thinking about this after reading
Ted’s latest post that [Agile is treating the symptoms not the
disease](http://blogs.tedneward.com/CommentView,guid,53f9b658-3b27-4f1a-b93e-14d3a57a8ec1.aspx#commentstart "Ted's blog post")
where the complexity that Agile introduces is disparaged and Access is
held up as one example of a great “simple” way to develop applications.

I agree that Access is great when you’re building a little database to
track Billy’s baseball cards. However, the real world doesn’t stay that
simple. As the [second law of
thermodynamics](http://blogs.tedneward.com/CommentView,guid,53f9b658-3b27-4f1a-b93e-14d3a57a8ec1.aspx#commentstart "Second Law of Thermodynamics")
states (paraphrasing here), **entropy tends to increase over time**,
which is something that Ted doesn’t address in his discussion.

I’m all for simplicity in our tools and methodologies as I think we
still have a lot of room for improvement in reducing [accidental
complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accidental_complexity "Accidental Complexit in Wikipedia").
Unfortunately, the business processes for which we build software are
not simple at all and full of [inherent
complexity](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essential_complexity "Inherent Complexity").
Oh sure, they may start off as a simple Access database, but they never
stay that simple. Every business I’ve ever interacted had very complex
sets of business processes, some seemingly [cargo
cultish](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult "Cargo Cult") in
origin, which led to major complexity in business processes.

Ted mentions friends of his who’ve made a healthy living using simple
tools to build simple line-of-business apps for customers. And I’m sure
they did a fine job of it. But I also made a healthy living in the past
coming in to clean up the externalities left by such applications.

I remember one rescue operation for a company drowning in the complexity
of a “simple” Access application they used to run their business. It was
simple until they started adding new business processes they needed to
track. It was simple until they started *emailing copies around*and were
unsure which was the “master copy”. Not to mention all the data
integrity issues and difficulty in changing the monolithic procedural
application code.

I also remember helping a teachers union who started off with a simple
attendance tracker style app (to use an example Ted mentions) and just
scaled it up to an atrociously complex Access database with stranded
data and manual processes where they printed excel spreadsheets to
paper, then manually entered it into another application. *I have to
wonder, why is that little school district in western Pennsylvania
engaging in custom software development in the first place? I don’t
engage in developing custom school curricula. An even simpler option is
to buy some off the shelf software or simply use a Wiki, but I
digress.* 

These were apps that would make The Daily WTF look like paragons of good
software development in comparison.

The core problem here is that while it’s fine to push for simpler tools
to reduce accidental complexity, at one point or another we are going to
have to deal with inherent complexity caused by entropy. Business
processes are inherently complex, usually more than they need to be, and
**this is not a problem that will be solved by any software**. Most are
not only inherently complex, but chock-full of accidental complexity as
well. Your line of business app won’t solve that. It takes systemic
change in the organization to make that happen.

Not only that, but business processes get more complex over time as
entropy sets in. The applications I mentioned dealt with this entropy
and reached a point where the current solution could not scale to meet
that new level of complexity (a different sort of scaling up), so they
started to drown in it, the original authors of the applications long
gone off to create new apps with new externalities.

Fortunately, the externalities of these applications didn’t cause
cancer, but rather kept guys like me employed. Of course, it was a
negative externality for the company who kept pumping cash to fix these
applications.

Ted paraphrases Billy suggesting that Agile requires even more complex
tools, story cards, continuous integration servers, etc. This is an
unfair characterization and misses the point of Agile. **Agile is less
about managing the complexity of an application itself and more about
managing the complexity of building an application**.

A higher principle of agile is YAGNI (You ain’t gonna need it) until you
need it. For example, the 1 to 2 guys in a garage probably don’t need a
continuous integration server, stand up meetings, etc and any real
agilist worth his or her salt would recognize that and not try to force
unnecessary procedures on a team that didn’t need it.

However, as the two garage dwellers start to grow the business and need
to coordinate with more developers, such tools come in handy. As you
grow a team beyond two people, the lines of communication start to grow
exponentially, thus creating inherent complexity.  Looking at the cost
of developing and maintaining an application over time is where you
start to get a full picture of the true cost of building an application.

As Robert Glass pointed out in [Facts and Fallacies of Software
Engineering](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321117425?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0321117425 "Facts and Fallacies of Software Engineering at Amazon"),
research shows that **maintenance typically consumes from 40 to 80
percent of software costs**, typically making it [the dominant life
cycle phase of a software
project](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/01/09/writing_maintainable_code.aspx "Writing Maintainable Code").
Thus these so called “simple” solutions need to factor that in, or the
customers will continually be left with the clean-up duty while the
polluters have long since moved on.
