A while back I wrote a riveting 3-part developer’s guide to copyright
law and open source licensing for developers.

-   [Developer's Guide to
    Copyright](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/TheDevelopersGuideToCopyrightLaw-Part1.aspx "Developer's Guide to Copyright Law part 1")
-   [Developer’s Guide to Open Source Software
    Licensing](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/24/DevelopersGuideToOpenSourceSoftwareLicensing.aspx "Open Source Licensing")
-   [Who Own’s The Copyright for an Open Source
    Project?](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/01/25/WhoOwnstheCopyrightforAnOpenSourceProject.aspx "Who owns the copyright")

I’m pretty sure you read every word at the edge of your seat. Who
doesn’t love reading about laws, licenses, and copyright!?

Seriously though, I hope some of you found it useful. In this post, I
want to talk about some recent developments that should make it easier
for developers to license their code.

A couple days ago I published a blog post on the [GitHub
blog](https://github.com/blog/1530-choosing-an-open-source-license "Choosing an open source license")
about an effort I’ve been involved with,
[http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/). Per the [about
page](http://choosealicense.com/about/):

> GitHub wants to help developers choose a license for their source
> code.
>
> If you already know what you’re doing and have a license you prefer to
> use, that’s great! We’re not here to change your mind. But if you are
> bewildered by the large number of OSS license choices, maybe we can
> help.

I’m interested in helping developers be explicit and clear about their
intent for their code. Adding a LICENSE (or an
[UNLICENSE](http://unlicense.org/ "Unlicense") if that’s your thing)
file to the root of your public repository is a good way to state your
intent. We even include an option if you really do want to retain all
rights to your code, you grinch (I kid! I do not judge.)

But before you can choose a license, you need to be informed about what
the license entails. That’s what we hope the site helps with.

Combined with the site, GitHub now has a feature that lets you choose a
license when creating a repository on GitHub.

That’s great! But what about all your existing projects? Well one of my
co-workers, [Garen
Torikian](https://twitter.com/gjtorikian "Garen on Twitter"), has you
covered. He built [http://addalicense.com/](http://addalicense.com/) as
a little side project. Note that the project is full of disclaimers:

> **This site is **not** owned by or affiliated with GitHub**. But I
> work there, and I'm using the API to add each new license file. You'll
> be asked to authenticate this app for your public repositories on the
> next page.

Perhaps in the future, we may integrate this into
[http://choosealicense.com/](http://choosealicense.com/).

But in the meanwhile check it out and get those projects licensed!
