By default, ASP.NET MVC leverages Data Annotations to provide
validation. The approach is easy to get started with and allows the
validation applied on the server to “float” to the client without any
extra work.

However, once you get localization involved, using Data Annotations can
really clutter your models. For example, the following is a simple model
class with two properties.

```csharp
public class Character {
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

Nothing to write home about, but it is nice, clean, and simple.  To make
it more useful, I’ll add validation and format how the properties are
displayed.

```csharp
public class Character {
  [Display(Name="First Name")]
  [Required]
  [StringLength(50)]]
  public string FirstName { get; set; }
  
  [Display(Name="Last Name")]
  [Required]
  [StringLength(50)]]
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

That’s busier, but not horrible. It sure is awful Anglo-centric though.
I’ll fix that by making sure the property labels and error messages are
pulled from a resource file.

```csharp
public class Character {
  [Display(Name="Character_FirstName", ResourceType=typeof(ClassLib1.Resources))]
  [Required(ErrorMessageResourceType=typeof(ClassLib1.Resources), 
    ErrorMessageResourceName="Character_FirstName_Required")]
  [StringLength(50, ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof(ClassLib1.Resources),
    ErrorMessageResourceName = "Character_FirstName_StringLength")]
  public string FirstName { get; set; }

  [Display(Name="Character_LastName", ResourceType=typeof(ClassLib1.Resources))]
  [Required(ErrorMessageResourceType=typeof(ClassLib1.Resources), 
    ErrorMessageResourceName="Character_LastName_Required")]
  [StringLength(50, ErrorMessageResourceType = typeof(ClassLib1.Resources),
    ErrorMessageResourceName = "Character_LastName_StringLength")]
  public string LastName { get; set; }
}
```

Wow! I don’t know about you, but I feel a little bit dirty typing all
that in. Allow me a moment as I go wash up.

So what can I do to get rid of all that noise? Conventions to the
rescue! By employing a simple set of conventions, I should be able to
look up error messages in resource files as well as property labels
without having to specify all that information. In fact, by convention I
shouldn’t even need to use the `DisplayAttribute`.

I wrote a custom **PROOF OF CONCEPT** `ModelMetadataProvider` that
supports this approach. More specifically, mine is derived from the
`DataAnnotationsModelMetadataProvider`.

What Conventions Does It Apply?
-------------------------------

The nice thing about this convention based model metadata provider is it
allows you to specify as little or as much of the metadata you need and
it fills in the rest.

### Providing minimal metadata

For example, the following is a class with one simple property.

```csharp
public class Character {
  [Required]
  [StringLength(50)]
  public string FirstName {get; set;}
}
```

When displayed as a label, the custom metadata provider looks up the
resource key, *{ClassName}\_{PropertyName},*and uses the resource value
as the label. For example, for the `FirstName` property, the provider
uses the key `Character_FirstName` to look up the label in the resource
file. I’ll cover how resource type is specified later.

If a value for that resource is not found, the code falls back to using
the property name as the label, but splits it using Pascal/Camel casing
as a guide. Therefore in this case, the label is “*First Name*”.

The error message for a validation attribute uses a resource key of
*{ClassName}\_{PropertyName}\_{AttributeName}*. For example, to locate
the error message for a `RequiredAttribute`, the provider finds the
resource key `Character_FirstName_Required`.

### Partial Metadata

There may be cases where you can provide some metadata, but not all of
it. Ideally, the metadata that you don’t supply is inferred based on the
conventions. Going back to previous example again:

```csharp
public class Character {
  [Required(ErrorMessageResourceType=typeof(MyResources))]
  [StringLength(50, ErrorMessageResourceName="StringLength_Error")]
  [Display(Name="First Name")]
  public string FirstName {get; set;}
}
```

Notice that the first attribute only specifies the error message
resource type. In this case, the specified resource type will override
the default resource type. But the resource key is still inferred by
convention (aka `Character_FirstName_Required`).

In contrast, notice that the second `StringLengthAttribute`, only
specifies the resource name, and doesn’t specify a resource type. In
this case, the specified resource name is used to look up the error
message using the default resource type. As you might expect, if the
`ErrorMessage` property is specified, that takes precedence over the
conventions.

The `DisplayAttribute` works slightly differently. By default, the
`Name` property is used as a resource key if a resource type is also
specified. If no resource type is specified, the `Name` property is used
directly. In the case of this convention based provider, an attempt to
lookup a resource value using the `Name` property as a resource always
occurs before falling back to the default behavior.

Configuration
-------------

One detail I haven’t covered yet is what resource type is used to find
these messages? Is that determined by convention?

Deteriming this by convention would be tricky so it’s the one bit of
information that must be explicitly specified when configuring the
provider itself. The following code in *Global.asax.cs* shows how to
configure this.

```csharp
ModelMetadataProviders.Current = new ConventionalModelMetadataProvider(
  requireConventionAttribute: false,
  defaultResourceType: typeof(MyResources.Resource)
);
```

The model metadata provider’s constructor has two arguments used to
configure it.

Some developers will want the conventions to apply to every model, while
others will want to be explicit and have models opt in to this behavior.
The first argument, `requireConventionAttribute`, determines whether the
conventions only apply to classes with the
`MetadataConventionsAttribute` applied.

The explicit folks will want to set this value to true so that only
classes with the `MetadataConventionsAttribute` applied to them (or
classes in an assembly where the attribute is applied to the assembly)
will use these conventions.

The attribute can also be used to specify the resource type for resource
strings.

The second property specifies the default resource type to use for
resource strings. Note that this can be overridden by any attribute that
specifies its own resource type.

Caveats, Issues, Potholes
-------------------------

This code is something I hacked together and there are a few issues to
consider that I could not easily work around. First of all, the
implementation has to mutate properties of attributes. In general, this
is not a good thing to do because attributes tend to be global. If other
code relies on the attributes having their original values, this could
cause issues.

I think for most ASP.NET MVC applications (in fact most web applications
period) this will not be an issue.

Another issue is that the conventions don’t work for implied validation.
For example, if you have a property of a simple value type (such as
int), the `DataAnnotationsValidatorProvider` supplies a
`RequiredValidator` to validate the value. Since this validator didn’t
come from an attribute, it won’t use my convention based lookup for its
error messages.

I thought about making this work, but it the hooks I need to do this
without a large amount of code don’t appear to be there. I’d have to
write my own validator provider (as far as I can tell) or register my
own validator adapters in place of the default ones. I wasn’t up to the
task just yet.
