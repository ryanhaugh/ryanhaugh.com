I arrived back in Los Angeles last night from Burning Man where I spent
the week in utter ignorance of the true scale of Hurricane Katrina. Only
today have I started to grasp the immense scale of the destruction.

Normally, I am a very dispassionate reader of the news, but maybe having
been in a place that practices radical inclusion and community, I feel a
deeper connection to my fellow humans. As I read the paper today, choked
up with emotion a few times. The photos and accounts were gut wrenching.
At the same time, I also grew deeply angry, as many others have.

It boggles the mind why it must take such a devastating catastrophe
before action is taken. My gut reaction is to pillory the
administration, but I’ll leave that to the pundits. Actions speak louder
than rants and do a much better job of making one feel better.

Recently, we’ve been trying to sell our HDTV on
[CraigsList](http://losangeles.craigslist.org/). My wife had the great
idea to donate the proceeds to the Red Cross after being moved by news
accounts of what was going on in New Orleans. She mentioned such and the
TV was snapped up immediately by a woman who used to live in the Big
Easy.

Now I am looking around wondering if there is more junk around here we
can sell and donate the proceeds to the [Red
Cross](https://give.redcross.org/?hurricanemasthead) or [Habitat for
Humanity](https://www.habitat.org/donation/generaldonation/default.aspx?media=habitat&lander=MP&sourcecode=10w39&tg=katrina&keyword=homepage_09022005)

If you feel you don’t have money you can afford to donate, consider
selling that piece of junk laying around in your closet gathering dust.
You don’t need it anyways and a little bit of cash is helpful.

If you are looking for other ways to help, check out the [Katrina relief
homepage on Craigs
