Found [this post in
RossCode](http://www.rosscode.com/blog/index.php?title=quick_hits&more=1&c=1&tb=1&pb=1)
which mentions a blog post that discusses how to [bind enumerations to
drop
downs](http://geekswithblogs.net/jawad/archive/2005/06/24/EnumDropDown.aspx),
something I’ve done quite often.

RossCode has an issue with using this approach personally because
typically, the display text of a drop down should have spaces between
words, which is not allowed in an enum value. For example...

```csharp
public enum UglinessFactor {
    ButtUgly,
    Fugly,
    NotSoBad,
}
```

In the preceding enumeration, you’d probably want the dropdown to
display “Butt Ugly” and not “ButtUgly”.

Well if you follow standard .NET naming conventions and Pascal Case your
enum values, the following method `SplitUpperCaseToString` may be of
service. It depends on another method `SplitUpperCase` which will split
a camel or pascal cased word into an array of component words.

As a refresher, a *Pascal Cased* string is one in which the first letter
of each word is capitalized. For example, `ThisIsPascalCased`. By
contrast, a *Camel Cased* string is one in which the first letter of the
string is lowercase, but the first letter of each successive word is
upper cased. For example, `thisIsCamelCased`.

```csharp
public static string SplitUpperCaseToString(this string source) {
  return string.Join(" ", SplitUpperCase(source));
}
 
public static string[] SplitUpperCase(this string source) {
  if (source == null) {
    return new string[] {}; //Return empty array.
  }
  if (source.Length == 0) {
    return new string[] {""};
  }
 
  StringCollection words = new StringCollection();
  int wordStartIndex = 0;
 
  char[] letters = source.ToCharArray();  char previousChar = char.MinValue;
  // Skip the first letter. we don't care what case it is.
  for (int i = 1; i < letters.Length; i++) {
    if (char.IsUpper(letters[i]) && !char.IsWhiteSpace(previousChar)) {
      //Grab everything before the current character.
      words.Add(new String(letters, wordStartIndex, i - wordStartIndex));
      wordStartIndex = i;
    }    previousChar = letters[i]; 
  }

  //We need to have the last word.
  words.Add(new String(letters, wordStartIndex,     letters.Length - wordStartIndex)); 
 
  string[] wordArray = new string[words.Count];
  words.CopyTo(wordArray, 0);
  return wordArray;
}
```

Try it out and let me know if it was useful for you.

**UPDATE (8/3/2010):**Fixed a bug so that this doesn’t affect strings
that already have spaces in them.
