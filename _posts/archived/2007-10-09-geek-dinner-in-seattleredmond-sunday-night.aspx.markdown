UPDATE: We decided on the [Three Lions
Pub](http://thethreelionspub.com/thethreelionspub.htm "3 lions pub website")
in Redmond at 7:30 PM

I’m going to be in Redmond next week and would love to get a geek dinner
together around 7:30 PM. My flight gets in at 5:18 PM so I hope that’s
doable. **Anybody interested in joining us?**

I think [Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman ComputerZen Blog"),
[Brad
Wilson](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/dotnetguy/ "Brad Wilson the .NET guy"),
[Scott
Koon](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/ "Scott Koon the Lazy Coder"), and
[Scott
Densmore](http://www.agileprogrammer.com/scottden/ "Scott Densmore of the CodePlex team") will
grace us with their presence. If you’re interested in showing up, post a
comment so we get a rough idea of numbers.

Topic for discussion, *Forget Separation of Concerns, what does MS Dev
Div have against [Spaghetti
Code](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code "Spaghetti code")? I
like spaghetti!*

Another potential topic of discussion, *Render on POST - A fool’s http
response or a pragmatic approach*? Choose a side and let the all-out
bare knuckle bloody brawl begin.

Final topic, if you believe GET is the one true way to render and prefer
redirect on POST, which one do you choose? *[302 or
303](http://www.w3.org/Protocols/rfc2616/rfc2616-sec10.html "Http Status Codes")*?
