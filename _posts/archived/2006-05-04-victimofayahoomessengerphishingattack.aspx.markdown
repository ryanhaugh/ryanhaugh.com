![Fish](http://haacked.com/images/fish.jpg) UPDATE:*I am back in
business. I have re-obtained control over my Yahoo account. So the IM
messages you receive from me are really from me. I won’t make this
mistake twice.*

Never operate a computer while sleep deprived. In fact, I am starting to
think people should be licensed to get on the internet much like you do
to drive a car. I am absolutely mortified to admit this, but I got
suckered in a phishing attack that occurred via Yahoo Messenger.

I received an IM from a former boss with a link to a geocities photo
gallery. When I clicked on the link, it looked just like a Yahoo photo
gallery. Thinking (or rather not thinking), “Oh yeah, Yahoo owns
Geocities now, right?” I logged in to see the photos. Big mistake. Right
then I had the sneaking suspicion that I had done something painfully
wrong.

And today, it was confirmed when a friend emailed me to tell me that I
got my password jacked. If you see an IM from me or anyone with the link
**http://www.geocities.com/ladivabev/photos\_pics.html** (or rather any
geocities link) **DO NOT CLICK ON IT**.

I cannot believe I fell for this. I am usually excellent at spotting and
ignoring these, but everybody has their off days. And lately, I have had
a string of them. I recently accidentally deleted all my backup data on
my external hard-drive. Sleep deprivation is a killer.

And if you receive an IM or Yahoo message from me, please know it is not
from me until further notice.
