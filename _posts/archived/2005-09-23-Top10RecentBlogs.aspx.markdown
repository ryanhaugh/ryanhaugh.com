Ok, I am looking for some blogging fresh meat, so I thought I’d try my
hand at starting a meme. The criteria is purposely vague and very
simple. I want you to list ten blogs you’ve really enjoyed reading
recently. Especially the underrated, undiscovered, recent finds. They
don’t have to be your favorite blogs of all time, just ones that have
caught your notice recently.

Here are the official rules...

-   The Blog must have an rss (or ATOM) feed.

Ok, that’s it. Here’s my list in no particular order...

-   **[Coding
    Horror](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff's Blog")**\
     Jeff Atwood does a great job of telling it like it is. He provides
    pragmatic insight into software development.
-   **[Apophenia](http://www.zephoria.org/thoughts/ "dana's Blog")**\
     Found danah boyd’s blog via Dare. She provides interesting insight
    into social networking softaware.
-   **[BurningBird](http://weblog.burningbird.net/ "Shelley's Blog")**\
     Shelley’s always been a good read, but the [pictures of
    balloons](http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/09/17/focusing/ "pics")
    has pushed her way up my list.
-   **[.NET
    Undocumented](http://wesnerm.blogs.com/net_undocumented/ "Wesner's Blog")**\
     I read Wesner Moise because he digs deep into .NET so I don’t have
    to.
-   **[ComputerZen](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott's Blog")**\
     For you .NET geeks out there, this isn’t really a *find* as his
    blog is quite widely read, and for good reason. He’s in this list as
    a sort of blogtime achievement award for continually putting out
    good content.
-   **[JonGalloway.ToString()](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon's Blog")**\
     Take my blog, remove most of the crap, and you have Jon Galloway’s
    blog. Yes, this makes my list despite the code title.
-   **[Sharp as a
    Marble](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/ "Robb's Blog")**\
     Robb’s humor is sharp and biting. He can insult twenty generations
    of your family and have you laughing about it.
-   **[Dare Obasanjo aka
    Carnage4Life](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/ "Dare's Blog")**\
    Look up the term *Job Security* in wikipedia and I wouldn’t be
    surprised if you found a picture of Dare. Only someone who knows he
    can get a job anywhere can say what he says about his employer and
    keep working. Fortunately someone over there recognizes he’s part of
    the solution, not the problem.
-   **[Neopoleon.com](http://neopoleon.com/blog/ "Rory's Blog")**\
     Need I say more? Only Rory can talk about suicidal thoughts and
    have you laughing about it. Don’t you feel like a schmuck now?
-   **[IanG on
    Tap](http://www.interact-sw.co.uk/iangblog/ "Ian's Blog")**\
     Nobody is always right, except maybe for Ian. For a real in-depth
    insight into C\# or IO Completion ports, Ian is the go to guy. This
    guy knows too much, I fear someone will take him out it.
