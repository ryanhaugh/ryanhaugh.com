I wasn’t prepared to write an end-of-year blog post given the impending
destruction of the world via a Mayan prophesied cataclysmic fury. But
since that didn’t pan out I figured I’d better get typing.

![reflections](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Reflections-on-2012_104D6/reflections_3.gif "reflections")

Those of us that are software developers shouldn’t be too surprised that
the world didn’t end. After all, how often do projects come in on time
within the estimated date amirite?! (high five to all of you).

Highlights of 2012
------------------

This year has just been a blast. As my kids turn five and three, my wife
and I find them so much more fun to hang out with. Also, this year I
[reached the one year
mark](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/12/07/one-year-at-github.aspx "One year at GitHub")
at the best place to work ever. Here’s a breakdown of some of the
highlights from the year for me.

-   **January** Twice a year we have an all-company summit where we get
    together, give talks, plan, and just have a great time together.
    This was my first one and I loved every moment of it.
-   **February** The MVP summit was in town. I wasn’t eligible to be an
    MVP as a recently departed employee, but I was eligible to host [my
    first GitHub
    Drinkup](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/02/23/github-drinkup-mvp-edition.aspx "GitHub Drinkp")
    for all the MVPs and others in town. We had a big crowd and a great
    time.
-   **March** I travelled to the home of the Hobbits, New Zealand to
    give a [keynote at
    CodeMania](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/08/27/codemania-love-to-code-keynote.aspx "Codemania keynote").
-   **April** My family and I visited Richard Campbell and his family in
    the Vancouver area. I also recorded [a Hanselminutes
    podcast](http://www.hanselminutes.com/312/aspnet-mvc-and-open-source-with-phil-haack "ASP.NET MVC and open source").
-   **May** We [released GitHub for
    Windows](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/05/21/introducing-github-for-windows.aspx "GitHub for Windows")
    in May. I also visited GitHub HQ this month for a mini-summit with
    the other native app teams and recorded more podcasts including
    [Herding Code](http://herdingcode.com/?p=384 "Herding Code") and
    [Deep Fried
    Bytes](http://deepfriedbytes.com/podcast/episode-86-announcing-github-for-windows/ "Deep Fried Bytes").
-   **June** I [spoke at NDC in Oslo
    Norway](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/06/19/talks-on-github-and-nuget.aspx "Talks on GitHub and NuGet").
    Had a great conference despite the awkward “Azure Girls” incident.
-   **July** Gave a last minute talk at ASPConf. The software I used to
    record it crashed and so there’s no recording of this talk sadly.
-   **August** Back in San Francisco for the GitHub all company summit.
    [I corner Skrillex](http://instagram.com/p/OSIylNNL1r/ "Skrillex")
    and force him to take a photo with me.
-   **September** Family vacation to Oahu Hawaii. I also end up [giving
    a talk to a local user
    group](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/09/05/git-and-github-talk-in-hawaii.aspx "Git and GitHub talk in Hawaii")
    and hosting a drink up. And my son started Kindergarten.
-   **October** I [spoke at
    MonkeySpace](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/10/21/monkeyspace-dotnet-oss.aspx "MonkeySpace")
    and got really fired up about the future of Open Source in the .NET
    world.
-   **November** At the end of the month I was a guest on the [.NET
    Rocks
    Roadshow](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/11/28/in-los-angeles-this-friday-for-net-rocks-roadshow.aspx ".NET Rocks Roadshow").
    We had a rollicking good time. I went on a private tour of SpaceX
    with the fellas. We took the RV to the venue and I got to sample
    some of the Kentucky Whiskey they collected on their travels [before
    recording a show on Git,
    GitHub](http://www.dotnetrocks.com/default.aspx?showNum=831 "Show #831"),
    NuGet, and the non-hierarchical management model we have at GitHub.
-   **December**This was a quiet month for me. No travels. No talks.
    Just hacking on code, spending time with the family, and celebrating
    one year at GitHub. Oh, I also loved watching this [Real Life Fruit
    Ninja to Dubstep
    video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w-llZmPPNwU "Fruit Ninja in Real Life to Dubstep").
    Perhaps the highlight of 2013.

Top 3 Blog Posts by the numbers
-------------------------------

As I did in 2010, I figured I’d post my top three blog posts according
to the [Ayende
Formula](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/09/Calculating-most-popular-posts-with-SubText.aspx "Ayende Formula").

-   [Introducing GitHub for
    Windows](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/05/21/introducing-github-for-windows.aspx "Introducing GitHub for Windows")
    introduces the Git and GitHub client application my team and I
    worked on this past year (*103 comments, 68,672 web views, 25,048
    aggregator views*).
-   [It’s the Little Things About ASP.NET MVC
    4](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/03/11/itrsquos-the-little-things-about-asp-net-mvc-4.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 4 highlights")
    highlights some of the small improvements in ASP.NET MVC 4 that are
    easy to overlook, but are nice for those that need them (*49
    comments 56900 web views, 26,044 aggregator views*)
-   [Structuring Unit
    Tests](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/01/structuring-unit-tests.aspx "Structuring unit tests.")
    covers a nice approach to structuring unit tests for C\# developers
    that I learned from others. This post was written in January which
    might help explain why it’s in the top three (*52 comments, 41,852
    web views, 26,073 aggregator views*).

My Favorite three posts
-----------------------

These are the three posts that I wrote that were my favorites.

-   [You Don’t Need a Thick
    Skin](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/12/17/you-do-not-need-a-thick-skin.aspx "You don't need a thick skin")
    describes the realization that rather than develop a thick skin, I
    should focus on developing more empathy for folks that use my
    software.
-   [One year at
    GitHub](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/12/07/one-year-at-github.aspx "One year at GitHub")
    is a look back at my year at GitHub and how much I’m enjoying
    working there.
-   [How to Talk to
    Employees](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/08/03/how-to-talk-to-employees.aspx "How to talk to employees")
    argues that the way to talk to employees is simply the way you’d
    want to be addressed.

You People
----------

Enough about me, let’s talk about you. As I did in my 2010 post, I
thought it’d be fun to post some numbers.

According to Google Analytics:

-   **Hello Visitors!** 1,880,184 absolute unique visitors (up 6.15%
    from 2011) made 2,784,021 (down half a %) visits to my blog. came
    from 223 countries/territories. Most of you came from the United
    States (875,837) followed by India (267,164) with the United Kingdom
    (221,727) in third place.
-   **Browser of choice:**Just two years ago, most of my visitors used
    Firefox. Now it’s Google Chrome with 45.84%. In second place at
    26.37% is Firefox  with IE users at 19.08%. Safari is next at 4%
    with Opera users still holding on to 2%. I really need to stop
    making those Opera user jokes. You guys are persistent!
-   **Operating System:** As I expected, most of you (87.16%) are on
    Windows, but that number seems to decline every year. 5.71% on a Mac
    and 2.24% on Linux. The mobile devices are a tiny percentage, but I
    would imagine that’ll pick up a lot next year.
-   **What you read:** The blog post most visited in 2012 was written in
    2011, [C\# Razor Syntax Quick
    Reference](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx "Razor Syntax Quick Reference")
    with 119,962 page views.
-   **How’d you get here:** Doesn’t take a genius to guess that most
    folks come to my blog via Google search results (1,691,540), which
    probably means most of you aren’t reading this. ![Winking
    smile](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Year-In-Review-2010-Edition_12A01/wlEmoticon-winkingsmile_2.png)
    StackOverflow moves to second place (292,670) followed closely by
    direct visitors (237,862).

My blog is just a single sample, but it’s interesting to me that these
numbers seem to reflect trends I’ve seen elsewhere.

Well that’s all I have for 2012. I’m sure there are highlights I forgot
to call out that are more memorable or important than the ones I listed.
I’m bad at keeping track of things.

One big highlight for me is all the encouraging feedback, interesting
comments, insightful thoughts, etc. that I’ve received from many of you
in the past year either through comments on my blog or via Twitter. I
appreciate it and I hope many of you have found something useful in
something I’ve written on my blog or on Twitter. I’ll work hard to
provide even more useful writings in the next year.

Happy New Year and I hope that 2013 is even better for you than 2012!
