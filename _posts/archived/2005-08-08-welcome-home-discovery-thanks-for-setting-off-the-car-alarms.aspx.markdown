![Shuttle Crew](http://haacked.com/images/ShuttleCrew.jpg) Very early
this morning my slumber was disturbed by an extremely lound noise. Like
Maverick in Top Gun, those durn shuttle astronauts did a fly by enroute
to Edwards, setting off car alarms and howling dogs in the neighborhood.
Couldn’t y’all have flown by quietly. There were people sleeping you
know. Next thing you know, them punk astronauts will attach a huge bass
subwoofer in the back of that thing, spinners, just to let you know
what’s up.

All kidding aside, I am glad to hear they made it back safe and sound (a
big sound). I wish I would have known they were swinging by. I wonder if
I would have been able to see it from here.
