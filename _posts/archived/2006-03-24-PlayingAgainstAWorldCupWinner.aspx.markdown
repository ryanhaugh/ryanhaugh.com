![LeBoeuf](http://haacked.com/images/LeBoeuf.jpg) You Europeans ought to
appreciate this one.

Iâ€™ve mentioned before that I joined a fairly competitive league here in
Los Angeles. The other day I found out that the team we are playing this
Saturday fields Frank Leboeuf. He played on the 1992 World Cup Winning
France National team and was a former starter for Chelsea.

![jrgen](http://haacked.com/images/JurgenKlinsman.jpg) His pro career
must be over, but it is still a surprise that he is in the same league.
He still looks like one bad mofo. I also hear that Jurgen Klinsmann
plays for an adult league team in Orange County. Seems like Southern
California is the place to be if you are a retired World Cup Footballer.
