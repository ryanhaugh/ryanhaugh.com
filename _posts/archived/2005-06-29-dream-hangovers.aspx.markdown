![Jaw Fragment](http://haacked.com/images/jawfragment.jpg) From the
title of his post, [Dream
Hangovers](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/archive/2005/06/30/3565.aspx),
I thought [Robb](http://sharpmarbles.stufftoread.com/) was going to tell
some story about another night of too much drinking and the painful
consequences afterwards. Instead he talks about how realistic dreams can
often influence your mood the following day.

A few nights ago I had a dream in which I kept biting down on something
hard. I spat the foreign object into my hand and was surprised to find a
molar. For some reason, losing my teeth is a typical nightmare for me
when I’m anxious. However this time, it was much more intense than
before.

After spitting out a few teeth, I noticed I was biting on something much
larger that felt like a rock or a piece of plaster. I spit it out and it
my hand was a gleaming pale chunk of my jaw. Another chunk came out and
I rushed to the bathroom to look in the mirror. When I opened my mouth,
my entire lower jaw caved in and blood started filled up my mouth and
pouring into the sink along with white pieces of my jaw. It reminded me
of a river full of floating icebergs. That’s when I woke up in a cold
sweat breathing very hard, furtively checking all my teeth with my
tongue.

After a few moments of abject terror, I calmed down and thanked my lucky
stars that all my teeth were there.
