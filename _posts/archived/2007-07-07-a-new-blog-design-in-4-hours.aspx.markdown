When summer arrives, many like to create a new look via a haircut or new
threads. I prefer to change the look of my blog with a new design.

This here design took all of four hours to complete.

Well that’s not exactly true.

It took all of four hours of **my time** to complete (give or take a
few).

You can probably see where I’m going with this if you’re one of the many
to have read *[The 4-Hour Workweek: Escape 9-5, Live Anywhere, and Join
the New
Rich](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0307353133?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0307353133 "The 4-Hour Workweek on Amazon.com")*
recently. Wondering what all the buzz was about I decided to go ahead
and purchase the book to see for myself.

What I expected was yet another time management book dispensing tired
advice on how to get more done in less time. Instead, the focus of this
book, written by [Tim
Ferriss](http://fourhourworkweek.com/blog/ "The Blog of Tim Ferriss") is
all about being more effective with your time by cutting out the cruft.
Don’t do more in less time, do less (more effectively) in less time.

In many respects, Tim is savage about cutting out time wasters in your
life such as email and reading the newspaper. He’s also a big fan of
mini-retirements and outsourcing your personal life. This book is not
about time management, it’s really about lifestyle management.

The outsourcing theme is one that particularly resonates with me. When I
first graduated from college, I used to always take my clothes to a
fluff and fold. Some friends told me I should do it myself since it
would “build character”. So would milking cows to gather my own milk,
but nobody faults me for picking up milk from Trader Joes. I figured I’d
rather spend that time playing soccer, so I would drop off the dirty
clothes before soccer and pick up the clean, dry, and folded clothes
right after. It felt like a perfect trade.

Fast forward and upon reading this book it occurred to me that I spend a
lot of time doing things I either don’t like to do, or things I like to
do but suck at. For example, I spent a lot of time trying to redesign my
blog to create a unique and polished look, only to come up short. I
realized I should look around for a designer interested in getting his
own name out there that might give me a discount for a design in
exchange for the promotion. This would allow me to spend that time
building a strength of mine rather than banging my head against a
weakness.

So after browsing various blog design sites I happened to stumble upon
[Scott Carnett](http://scott.carnett.name/ "Scott Carnett") over in
Abilene, TX. After pitching him the idea, he was on board and excited to
work on the design. I only found out after we started that he’s a Java
developer by day and design is a little side thing he’s into. I had it
in my head that he was full-time freelancer.

Not that any of that matters. I am very pleased with the design he has
created and recommend him highly if you’re looking for a bit of design
work. He was extremely pleasant to work with and provided a quick
turnaround. I have a few other ideas for the future that I may
collaborate with him on.
