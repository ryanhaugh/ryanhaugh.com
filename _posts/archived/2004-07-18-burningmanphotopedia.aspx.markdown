I promised a friend Iâ€™d show him some pictures of the time we went to
burning man in 2002. So of course, I figured might as well make a blog
entry about it. For you geeks out there, the Playa (A nearly level area
at the bottom of an undrained desert basin, sometimes temporarily
covered with water) has a wi-fi network available. Every year, Black
Rock City, a temporary city, is formed in the midst of the desert near
Gerlach. This city is the host of the Burning Man festival. It's about a
thirteen hour drive from Los Angeles and the closest city is Reno,
Nevada which is about 4 hours away.

Let me introduce you to the gang of burners (people who attend Burning
Man) that we camped with. Here we are demonstrating the preferred method
of locomotion on the Playa. This assumes you're sober enough to ride
correctly, which isn't as much an issue during the day as it is at
night.

Although the heat is oppresive by day, there's plenty to see. One of my
favorite installations is a replica of the **Terror Dome** from Mad Max
movies. That's Akumi and myself climbing on it. At night, the dome is
covered with people cheering on epic battles as two would-be gladiators
strapped with bungie cords swing around whacking each other with foam
padded sticks.

The primary danger on the playa is overheating and dehydration, so be
sure to bring plenty of water. That's not to say that there aren't other
unexpected hazards on the playa.

Every year, Burning Man has a theme. The year we went the theme was "A
floating world". This explains the presence of dolphins.

Some of the installations on the playa are truly magnificent, such as
the **Temple Of Joy**. The prior year, the artist who built this temple
had built the Temple Of Tears as he had tragically lost a family member
(I think his daughter). But in having overcome the pain and sorrow, he
built this temple to celebrate the joy he had with her.

And then, of course, there's the Man. At night, the Man is totally wired
with bright blue neon lights. From any point in the camp, you can pretty
much see him standing there as a beacon. Very useful if you happen to be
trashed and have wandered off into the darkness of the playa. It's
nearly impossible to get truly lost out there, but people are
resourceful and manage to find a way.

There are the occasional dust storms that can be downright aggravating.
We only had to endure one or two. Huddling in the shade shelter we built
in the middle of our camp site, we battened down the hatches and munched
on snacks. Afterwards, a dust storm will leave a really beautiful sky in
its wake.

At night, as the temperature dives, the playa really comes alive. I
unfortunately don't have a lot of night pictures, but believe me when I
tell you that anything and everything you've ever imagined in your sleep
is crawling around. This place creates a bull market for the neon and
glowstick industry. All the colored lights create a surreal nighttime
wonderland. For example, as we walked about, we almost ran into this
moving aquarium full of laughing people.

Every day on the playa is a build-up to the big day when they burn the
Man. Preceding the burn is a parade of fire walkers, dancers, and
mechanical fire-breathing dragons. It's truly a pyromaniac's wet dream.
The intense heat of "The Burn" conjures up several dust devils with the
appearance of sinister tornados dancing on the ashes of the Man. The
following day, the Temple of Joy is burned, but we didn't stay around to
see that.
