I credit Google [AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/ "AdSense") for
really opening up the possibility for small blogs to become sources of
passive income. Look around the web and you’ll see nearly every blog
sport an AdSense ad or two…or three.

For most people, it amounts to a bit of pocket change - maybe enough
money for a coffee or an occasional indulgence. But soon, the lure of
adding more ads from other ad networks overwhelms publishers and soon
blogs start to look more like the movie
[Idiocracy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0387808/ "Idiocracy on IMDB").

A while back, [Jeff Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror")
wrote about how content is becoming dwarfed by advertisements in his
post, [A World of Endless
Advertisements](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000772.html "On Ads and Content on the web"),
which is where I took that photo. I was heading down that path when I
read his post and it gave me pause.

At that time, I had recently started a new business with a friend and we
were struggling, so any source of extra income was welcome. But I was
always hoping to tone it down a bit.

Now I’m at a pretty [stable company](http://microsoft.com/ "Microsoft"),
so I don’t necessarily need the extra income, but I don’t mind it
because I also have a kid who can eat us out of house and home.
Fortunately, I have the opportunity to have my cake and eat it too by
removing all of my ads except for [The
Lounge](http://theloungenet.com/Home "The Lounge Ad Network"). Hopefully
this makes my site move farther and farther from the screenshot above.

[James Avery](http://infozerk.com/averyblog/ "James Avery") and I go way
back. He’s been involved with
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Blog Engine") in the past,
I contributed some chapters to [a
book](http://www.windevpowertools.com/default.aspx "Windows Developer Power Tools")
he and [Jim Holmes](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/ "Jim Holmes") put
together. Like many relationships forged in the online community, we’ve
never actually met in person, but I feel like I’ve known the guy for a
long time.

What I like about James is he’s a real hustler, which you have to be as
an independent entrepreneur/consultant/contractor. He seems to be
executing on a huge roster of ideas all at once all the time. I’ve gone
that route, and found it both exhilarating and downright tough. So my
hats off to James.

The other notable thing about The Lounge is that James is using ASP.NET
MVC to build it out and is so far finding the experience to be a good
one. Right James?
