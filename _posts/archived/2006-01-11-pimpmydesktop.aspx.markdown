![Pimped Desktop](http://haacked.com/images/pimpeddesktop.jpg) Ryan
Farley [gives the
lowdown](http://ryanfarley.com/blog/archive/2006/01/11/14992.aspx?Pending=true)
on his tricked out desktop.

In the past I’ve tried to get into tricking out the desktop, but
everytime I switched to a new computer, I felt less and less inclined to
do invest the time. Besides, I remember some of these programs would
slow down the OS. I like my desktop to be lean and mean.

But after seeing Ryan’s screenshot, I may have to consider playing
around with some of the customizations.

It’s funny to me how many geeks I know would dread spending time
selecting drapery and customizing the small details of their house
(“Pick any color, honey. I don’t care.”) yet will obsess over every
pixel of their desktop.
