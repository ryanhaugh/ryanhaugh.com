This [article in Boing
Boing](http://www.boingboing.net/2006/01/27/world_of_warcraft_do.html "Article on sexuality in World of Warcraft")
about how World of Warcraft (WoW) moderators are warning groups not to
adverties their guilds as “GBLT-friendly” (Gay, Bi-sexual, Lesbian,
Transgender friendly) got me thinking.

Suppose they allow characters in WoW to publicly declare their sexuality
within the game. Now suppose other groups within the game form with the
goal of attacking such players completely within the online game
(assuming the game allows players to attack other players).

Would that constitute a hate crime?
