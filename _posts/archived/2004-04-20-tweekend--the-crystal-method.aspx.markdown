![Tweekend](/images/Tweekend.JPG)Pulled this classic CD out of the crate
for a little funky listening today. It starts off with a robotic funky
track in "PHD" and progresses through some ragin' rock in "Name of the
Game" before settling down into a lush soundscape with "Blowout", my
favorite track on the CD.

Though it lacks the commercial appeal of their earlier hit "Vegas", I
tend to favor Tweekend probably because of its lack of overexposure.
