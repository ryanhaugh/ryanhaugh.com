I have a few GMail invites to give away. If you don't mind having a
profit driven corporation scanning the contents of your emails in order
to target you with ads, then post a funny comment with your email
address. Or just post a bland comment. I don't really care.

In return, you'll get a free web-based email account with 1000 MB of
storage and the power of the Google search engine for searching your
emails.

Sorry. I'm all out.
