A strange phenomena occurred last night and into this morning here in
Los Angeles. I kid you not, but **water**... fell from the **SKY**!

Near panic ensued throughout the city as Angelenos tried to make sense
of this unexpected situation. My league soccer game was cancelled due to
poor field conditions (aka mud).

Fortunately, I had a backup plan. Every Saturday and Sunday I have a
pick-up game with a wonderful group of people. The field we play on was
in need of water and by 2 PM was in perfect condition. Water even fell
from the sky again in the midst of our game. It was a beautiful
experience.

Afterwards, my brother-in-law took us out for dinner at The Lobster. Oh
man, is that food ever good! Try the scallops.
