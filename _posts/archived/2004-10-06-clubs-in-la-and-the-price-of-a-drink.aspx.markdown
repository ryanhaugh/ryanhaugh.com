With my brother-in-law in town from Tokyo, it is important that we
survey the local club scene. Serious business. The past two Saturdays we
went out to see different DJs at Avalon. I'm not sure I want to go back
any time soon.

One thing that bothers me is the price of a drink at a club. I expect a
mark up, but \$10 for a few squirts of alcohol in a plastic cup!? Give
me a break! Those prices are insane and it literally sickened me. After
my fourth drink.
