I saw [this story](http://www.qdb.us/53151) on the [debugging section of
Anecdota](http://www.anecdota.org/debugging/) and thought it was funny,
though I find it hard to believe.

You would think he’d do a test run for smaller digits of PI, but I’ve
done things like that.  You make a small test run. It works. You make a
tiny tweak that shouldn't affect anything and then start it running
because you're in a hurry.  Seven years later...

Of course, most (if not all) algorithms for calculating PI aren’t all or
nothing.  Usually they start calculating digits immediately, so
there ought to be immediate output as you calculate PI to further and
further digits, unless this person decided to store all billion digits
in a string before displaying it.
