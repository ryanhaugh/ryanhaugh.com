[Greg
Duncan](http://coolthingoftheday.blogspot.com/2006/06/satisfy-your-80s-music-video-fix.html "Greg Duncan")
is now my hero for [this
find](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/ "80s Music Videos"). This just
proves that I am still unable to let go of the 80s.

Unfortunately, some of the *flagship* songs of certain groups are
missing in place of other videos. For example, instead of *Pour Some
Sugar* from Def Leppard we get *Photograph*. Likewise where is
*Loveshack* from the B52s?

Some notable videos (both good and bad):

-   [Club Nouveau - Lean on
    Me](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=4ilWMYifVlc "Lean on Me")
    - Quite possibly my favorite song of the 80s for some reason.
-   [U2 - With or Without
    You](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=li99qCf100w "With or Without You")
    - My Other Favorite Song of the 80s.
-   [Debarge - Rhythm of the
    Night](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=iBwXKSNue6A "Rhythm")
    - Just look at this guy. But admit that you liked the song, just not
    in public.
-   [Def Leppard -
    Photograph](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=GBi2P9VCqMs "Photograph")
    - It isn’t *Pour Some Sugar* but it is still Def Leppard! Recognize!
-   [Public Enemy - Don’t Believe the
    Hype](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=2bT_JW-eseQ "Don’t Believe The Hype")
    - Flavor Flav took time pieces to the next level.
-   [MC Hammer - U Can’t Touch
    This](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=nG8k8Py9IPI "You Can’t Touch This")
    - Please Hammer, don’t hurt them. Please.
-   [Metallica - Master of
    Puppets](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=ToNRGFETLqY "Master of Puppets")
    - Biggest Metal Band in History.
-   [Depeche Mode - Just Can’t Get
    Enough](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=dIuIHqRAbxI "Just Can’t Get Enough")
    - Well I agree. I just can’t enough.
-   [Bangles - Walk Like An
    Egyptian](http://www.freephotosandvideos.com/videos.php?vid=bdRaLuKhobU "Walk Like An Egyptian")
    - Who didn’t have a crush on the lead singer?

There are too many to list.
