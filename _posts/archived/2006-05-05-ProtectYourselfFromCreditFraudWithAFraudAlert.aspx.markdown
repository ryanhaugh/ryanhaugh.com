![Stop Fraud!](http://haacked.com/images/stop_sign.jpg) So after getting
my [Yahoo password
phished](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/05/04/VictimOfAYahooMessengerPhishingAttack.aspx "Stupid Mistake"),
my wife reminded me that we should put a fraud alert on our credit file.
I first heard about this from my friend Walter a while ago, but we never
got around to it.

This is a flag that the major credit bureaus (experian, equifax, and
TransUnion) attach to your credit report. If someone (including
yourself) tries to open up a new credit account, the lender is supposed
to (though not required by law) to contact you by phone to make sure
that you really do want to open a new account.

Keep in mind that this applies to applying for a new credit card,
obtaining a car loan, purchasing a cell phone, etc...

Setting up a fraud alert is pretty easy. There are three major credit
bureaus you can call, but I prefer to do these things online. If you go
to
[https://www.experian.com/fraud/](https://www.experian.com/fraud/ "Experian"),
you can apply for the initial security alert (90 days) via the internet.
They will forward the alert to the other two credit bureaus so you
shouldnâ€™s have to call them. One other benefit is that they let you
print out your credit history online for free.

If you live in California, the protections are much better. According to
California Law SB 168, you have the right to *freeze* your credit record
at each bureau. This makes it impossible to issue credit in your name,
even for someone armed with your name, address, Social Security Number,
etc... To do this, you do need to contact each bureau in writing and
send in \$10.

For instructions on the benefits of a credit freeze and how to contact
each credit bureau, check out [this
page](http://www.fightidentitytheft.com/legislation_california_sb168.html)
on the Fight Identity Theft website.

Apparently similar laws apply to the following states at the time of
this writing (CT, IL, LA, ME, NV, NC, TX, VT, WA).
