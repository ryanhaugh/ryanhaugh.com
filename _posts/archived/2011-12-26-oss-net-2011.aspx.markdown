T’is the season for “Year in Review” and “Best of” blog posts. It’s a
vain practice, to be sure. This is exactly why I’ve done [it almost
every
year](http://haacked.com/tags/Year-in-review/default.aspx "Year in review")!
After all, isn’t all [blogging pure
vanity](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/bloggingispurevanity.aspx "Blogging is pure vanity")?
Sadly, I did miss a few years when my vanity could not overcome my
laziness.

This year I am changing it up a bit to look at some of the highlights,
*in my opinion*, that occurred in 2011 with open source software and the
.NET community. I think it’s been a banner year for OSS and
.NET/Microsoft, and I think it’s only going to get better in 2012.

![NuGet
Logo](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/A-Look-Back-Open-Source-and-.NET-2011_CBF9/nugetlogo_3.png "NuGet")

We released NuGet 1.0 in the [beginning of this
year](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/13/aspnetmvc3-released.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3")
and it had a big impact on the amount of sleep I got last year. Insomnia
aside, it’s also had a significant impact on the .NET community and been
[very well
received](http://nuget.codeplex.com/wikipage?title=What%20people%20are%20saying "What folks are saying about NuGet").

One key benefit of NuGet is it provides a central location for people to
discover and easily acquire open source libraries. This alone helps many
open source libraries gain visibility. According to
[http://stats.nuget.org/](http://stats.nuget.org/), the NuGet gallery
now has over 4,000 unique packages and 3.4 Million package downloads.

[Scott
Hanselman](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman's Blog")
noted another impact I hadn’t considered in his [DevReach 2011
keynote](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqVTIGPPFWo "DevReach 2011 Keynote").
To understand his observation, I need to provide a bit of background.

Back in April, Microsoft released the ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools update. This
added support for pre-installed NuGet packages in the ASP.NET MVC 3
project templates so that projects created from these templates already
include dependent libraries installed as NuGet packages rather than as
flat files in the project. This allows developers who create a project
from a template to upgrade these libraries after the project has been
created via NuGet.

NuGet 1.5 adds this support for pre-installed packages to any project
template that wants it. In the preview for ASP.NET MVC 4, we included
libraries such as ModernizR, jQuery, jQuery UI, jQuery Validation, and
Knockout in this manner. We expect other project templates in the future
to take advantage of this as well.

The interesting observation Hanselman had in his keynote is that this is
an example of Microsoft giving equal billing to these open source
libraries as it does to its own. When you create an ASP.NET MVC 4
project, your project includes Microsoft packages alongside 3rd party
OSS packages all installed in the same manner.

Additionally, the way NuGet itself was developed is also important.
NuGet is an Apache v2 open source project that accepts contributions
from the community. Microsoft gave it to the Outercurve Foundation and
continues to supply the project with employee contributors.

Orchard Project
---------------

Before there was NuGet, there was
[Orchard](http://orchard.codeplex.com/ "Orchard Project"). Orchard is an
open source CMS system that was started at Microsoft, but also
contributed to the OuterCurve Foundation.

What’s really impressive about Orchard is the amount of community
involvement they’ve fostered. They’ve set up a governance structure
consisting of an [elected steering
committee](http://orchard.codeplex.com/discussions/270600 "Steering committee")
so that it’s truly a community run project.

They recently surpassed 1 million module downloads from their [online
gallery](http://gallery.orchardproject.net/ "Modules"). Modules are
extensions to Orchard that are installable directly from within the
Orchard admin.

Umbraco
-------

[Umbraco](http://umbraco.com/ "Umbraco") is an independent open source
CMS that has a huge following and a strong community. They’ve been
around for a while, long before 2011. But in 2011, Microsoft hosted the
redesigned [http://asp.net/](http://asp.net/) site using Umbraco.

Micro ORMS
----------

For a lack of better term, I think 2011 was the year of the mini-ORMS.
While many refere to these libraries as micro-ORMS, they’re not
technically ORMs. They’re more simple data access libraries. A
non-comprehensive list of the ones that made a big splash are:

-   The diminutively named
    [Massive](https://github.com/robconery/massive "Massive")
-   The straightforwardly named
    [Simple.Data](https://github.com/markrendle/Simple.Data "Simple.Data")
-   The fashionable
    [Dapper.NET](http://code.google.com/p/dapper-dot-net/ "Dapper.NET")

If you’re interested in seeing a more comprehensive list of Micro ORMS
with source code examples of usage (Nice!), [check out this blog
post](http://yobriefca.se/blog/2011/06/21/microorms-for-dotnet-inserts-updates-deletes/ "Micro-ORMS for .NET")
by [James Hughes](http://yobriefca.se/ "James Hughes").

Micro Web Frameworks and OWIN
-----------------------------

Like pairing a good beer with the right steak, lightweight micro-web
frameworks provide a good pairing with Micro-ORMS. It’s interesting
that  both of these picked up quite a bit this past year.

Some that caught my attention this year are:

-   Named after Sinatra’s daughter, there’s the
    [Nancy](https://github.com/NancyFx/Nancy#readme "Nancy") micro web
    framework.
-   [FubuMVC](http://mvc.fubu-project.org/ "Fubu Project") is billed as
    the project that gets out of your way.
-   [OpenRasta](https://github.com/openrasta/openrasta-stable/wiki) is a
    resource oriented web framework for building REST services.

Again, James Hughes provides a [comparative list of micro-web
frameworks](http://yobriefca.se/blog/2011/07/18/micro-web-frameworks-101-tinyweb/ "Comparative list of micro-web frameworks")
complete with source code examples.

With the proliferation of web frameworks as well as lightweight web
servers such as [Kayak](http://kayakhttp.com/ "Kayak") and [Manos de
Mono](http://jacksonh.tumblr.com/post/1159500924/manos-de-mono-the-manifesto "Manos de Mono"),
the need to decouple the one from the other arose. This is where OWIN
stepped into the gap.

OWIN stands for [Open Web Interface for .NET](http://owin.org/ "OWIN").
It is a project inspired by [Rack, a
Ruby](http://rack.rubyforge.org/ "Rack") Webserver interface, meant to
decouple web servers from the web application frameworks that run on
them.

This project was started as a completely grass roots project in 2011 but
has seen amazing pick-up from the community and I believe will have a
big impact in 2012.

[Miguel de Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel De Icaza's Blog")
wrote [a monster blog
post](http://tirania.org/blog/archive/2011/Dec-21.html "Mono 2011")
about the year that he and the Mono (and Xamarin) folks have had in
2011. His post inspired me to write this less monstrous one. It’s a
great post and really inspiring to see how they’ve emerged from the
ashes of the great Novell layoff of 2011 to have a great year.

In the following image, you can see me teaching Miguel everything he
knows about software development and open source while Scott acts
surprised?

![](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/A-Look-Back-at-Mix-11_D597/trouble-inc_2.jpg)

What really caught my interest in his post was the note about Microsoft
using Mono and Unity3D to build [Kinectimals for
iOS](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/kinectimals/id482365195?mt=8 "Kinectimals")
systems such as the iPad. 2011 seems to be the year of pigs flying for
Microsoft.

Xamarin is doing a great job of bringing Mono, and consequently C\# and
open source to just about every device imaginable!

Open Source Fest at ![Mix 11](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/A-Look-Back-Open-Source-and-.NET-2011_CBF9/mix11-logo_3.jpg "Mix 11")
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mix is one of my favorite conferences and I’ve attended every single
one. And it has nothing to do with it being in Las Vegas, though that
doesn’t hurt one bit.

This year was special due to the efforts of [John
Papa](http://johnpapa.net/ "John Papa's Blog") (*who’s name makes me
wonder if he ever goes all Biggie Smalls on people and sings “I love it
when you call me John Papa”*). This year, John put together the [Open
Source Fest at
Mix](http://live.visitmix.com/OpenSourceFest "Open Source Fest at Mix 2011").

This was an event where around 50 projects had stations in a large open
room where they could represent their project and talk to attendees. The
atmosphere was electric as folks went from table to table learning about
useful software directly from the folks who built it.

This is where projects such as
[Glimpse](http://getglimpse.com/ "Glimpse") got noticed and really took
off. Would love to see more of this sort of thing at conferences.

Azure SDKs and GitHub
---------------------

As I recently wrote on the [GitHub
blog](https://github.com/blog/1010-azure-on-github "Azure on GitHub"),
Microsoft is actively developing a set of Azure SDKs for multiple
platforms (not just .NET) [in
GitHub](https://github.com/WindowsAzure/azure-sdk-for-net "Azure SDK for .NET in GitHub").
All of these libraries are Apache v2 licensed and actively being
developed in GitHub.

![screenshot of the azure sdk
homepage](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/A-Look-Back-Open-Source-and-.NET-2011_CBF9/Source-code-on-github_3.png "Azure SDK source code on GitHub")

It’s great to see Microsoft not only releasing source code under an open
source license, but actively developing it in the open and ostensibly
accepting contributions from the public. I look forward to seeing more
of this in the future.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Last but not least, there’s GitHub. Full disclaimer: [I’m an employee of
GitHub](https://github.com/blog/1002-phil-haack-is-a-githubber "Phil Haack is a GitHubber")
so naturally my opinion is totally biased. But a bias doesn’t
necessarily mean an opinion is wrong.

What I love about GitHub is that just about **everybody** is there.
GitHub hosts a huge number of open source projects, including a large
number of the important ones you’ve heard of. Quantity alone isn’t a
sign of quality, but it can create network effects. When a site has such
a large community, hosting a project there makes it easier to attract
contributors because there’s such a large pool to draw from.

I’ve seen this benefit .NET open source projects first hand. Since
moving some of my projects there, I’ve received more pull requests.
Small independent projects such as JabbR have really attracted a
passionate community at GitHub with large numbers of external
contributions. Most of the credit must go to the efforts of the great
project leads who’ve worked hard to foster a great community, but I
think they’d agree that hosting on GitHub certainly makes it easier and
more enjoyable.

What did I miss?
----------------

Did I miss anything significant in your opinion? Let me know in the
comments. What do you think will happen in 2012? Does the number 2012
look like a science fiction year to you? Because it does to me. I can’t
believe it’s just about here already. Have a great holidays!

**UPDATE: Egg on my face. This post was meant to list a few highlights
and not be a comprehensive list of all that happened in open source in
the .NET space. Even so, in my holiday infused malaise, I was negligent
in omitting several highlights. I apologize and updated the post to
reflect a few more significant events. Let me know if I missed some
obvious ones.**
