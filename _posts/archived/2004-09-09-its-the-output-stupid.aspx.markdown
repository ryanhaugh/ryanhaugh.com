![Fountain Pen](/images/fountainPen.jpg) I read with amusement this
[recent post](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2004/09/09.html#a8202) on
[Scoble’s blog](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) in which someone
writes him a note dictating the tools that “Influencers” use.

> Influencers use weird crap. They use Macs and Linux, Mozilla, and
> other eminently hackable systems. They don’t generally run Windows and
> IE.

This is very similar to [Paul Graham’s
view](http://www.paulgraham.com/gh.html) of what makes a great hacker,
which revolves around the tools a hacker uses.

I don’t understand this focus on trying to nail the qualities of a great
person (be it hacker or influencer) by focusing on the technologies the
person uses. Let’s look back at influential writers such as Shakespeare
and Whitman, they used pen and paper. Aha! Great writers use Pen and
Paper.

When history looks back on great writers, I guarantee you that we do not
focus on the tools they used. Rather, we focused on what they did. Their
**output**. Do I know or even care what tools Steinbeck used to write
*The Grapes Of Wrath* or Silvia Plath used to write *Ariel*? Hardly.
It’s the legacy of their work and accomplishments that are remembered.

**Call To Action** Stop wasting your time trying to find the root of
greatness by taking your narrow microscope and examining the tools a
great person uses. This is as effective as documenting a randomly chosen
idiosyncratic tick a person has to determine the cause of his or her
influence. You’re trying to push an agenda and you’re not helping
anyone. If you want to be a great hacker, influencer, or writer, focus
on the necessary skills instead.
