![The Viper
Room](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/TheViperRoom_91DC/ViperRoom%5B13%5D.jpg)Last
night I went to the “[World Famous Viper
Room](http://www.viperroom.com/ "Viper Room")”.  Gotta respect that
their website makes sure to mention the *World Famous* part.  I suppose
you’d have to have a real club inferiority complex to promote your club
as *The In This Neighborhood Sorta Famous Viper Room*.

Anyways, the purpose of my visit was to see my soccer (sorry, football)
teammate and team captain
[Pete](http://myspace.com/petesolomusic "Pete Mcleod") perform in the
acoustic lounge, an intimate (read tiny) lounge downstairs from the main
room.

Pete’s the one from Glasgow with a heavy Scottish brogue.  We can hardly
understand him most of the time, though I'm getting better at it. 
Usually I just nod my head in agreement.

After our last game we asked Pete if he’d get us on the guest list. 
“Not after that performance I won't.” was his reply...I think.  He was
referring to the [12 to 1
drubbing](http://westsiderovers.com/archive/2006/10/23/Hollywood_Run_Riot.aspx "Hollywood Run Riot")
received at the hands of Hollywood United.  This is the team fielding 9
internationally capped players and two World Cup players, one of whom
was on the winning squad of the 1998 champions.

In contrast, we are fielding one internationally capped player who
played for the Cayman Islands.  We should be making some acquisitions
for the next season that should help.  Our goal for the next season is
to keep them in the single digits.  Incremental improvements, ya know?
