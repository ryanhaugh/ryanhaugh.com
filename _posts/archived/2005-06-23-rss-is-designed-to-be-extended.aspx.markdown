![RSS](http://haacked.com/images/RSSLOGO.jpg) Now repeat after me, “RSS
is designed to be extended.”

Good. Now repeat it again. It’s old hat that Microsoft has engaged in
some perhaps anti-competitive practices in the past, often referred to
as their “embrace and extend” philosophy. But embracing and extending
isn’t always a bad thing.

Of course, I should expect a [knee-jerk
reaction](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/06/24/183213&from=rss)
against the announcement from the Slashdot crowd, but it seems they’re
not [the only
ones](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/06/24.html#a10463) up in
arms.

What’s interesting about these reactions is the amount of misinformation
and ignorance being spewed forth. Suddenly, “extend” has become a
derogatory label. Yet these very same people will laud an application
like Eclipse for its...gasp!...extensibility (and rightly so).

In this case, it’s hard to find a shred of so called “evil” in this
announcement by Microsoft. They’ve chosen a CopyLeft license for Pete’s
sake! You don’t get more open than that. You even have [Lawrence
Lessig](http://www.lessig.org/blog/) applauding this, remember him? He“s
the lawyer who helped the DOJ mount its Supreme Court showdown with
Microsoft.

Face it folks, you’re just wrong this time. Microsoft releasing
extensions to RSS is not going to be the death knell for RSS. An
extension does not change or make proprietary the original [RSS
specification](http://blogs.law.harvard.edu/tech/rss). As I said before,
RSS is designed to be extended. Anyone can extend RSS. Heck, even I
[proposed an RSS
extension](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/04/24/359.aspx), albeit one
that gained just about zero traction (although I may sneak it into
Subtext just to satisfy my megalomaniacal urges).
