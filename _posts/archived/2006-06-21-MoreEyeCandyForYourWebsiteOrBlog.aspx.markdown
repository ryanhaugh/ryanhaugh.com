Via a reader, I [learned about
iBox](http://www.ibegin.com/blog/p_ibox.html "IBox") which is similar to
[Lightbox
JS](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/05/LightboxJS2.0Released.aspx "Lightbox JS")
but with more features. It boasts the following benefits:

-   Small size. Total javascript is under 11kb.
-   Versatile. Handles images, external HTML pages, inline DIV elements.
-   Self contained. The script does not require any external libraries.
-   Support for non-JS users, which isnâ€™t hugely important to me.

Check out the [iBox
Demo](http://www.ibegin.com/ibox/ibox-test.html "iBox Demo").
