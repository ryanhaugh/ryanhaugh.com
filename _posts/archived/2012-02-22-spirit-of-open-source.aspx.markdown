[In my previous
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/02/16/open-source-and-open-source-software-are-not-the-same.aspx "My Previous Post"),
I attempted to make a distinction between Open Source and Open Source
Software. Some folks took issue with the post and that’s great! I love a
healthy debate. It’s an opportunity to learn. One minor request though.
If you disagree with me, I do humbly ask that you read the whole post
first before you go and rip me a new one.

It was interesting to me that critics fell into two opposing camps.
There were those who felt that it was was disingenuous for me to use the
term “open source software” to describe a Microsoft project that doesn’t
accept contributions and is developed under a closed model, even if it
is licensed under an open source license. Many of them accepted that,
yes, ASP.NET MVC is OSS, but I still shouldn’t use the term.

While others felt that the license is the sole determining factor for
open source and I wasn’t helping anybody by trying to expand the
definition of “open source.” To my defense, I wasn’t trying to expand it
so much as describe how I think a lot of people use the term today, but
they have a good point.

Going back to the first camp, a common refrain I heard was that software
that meets the [Open Source
Definition](http://opensource.org/docs/osd "Open Source Definition")
might “meet the letter of the law, but not the spirit of the law” when
it comes to open source.

Interesting. But what is the “spirit of open source” that they speak of?
What is the **essential**ingredient?

Looking For The Spirit
----------------------

I assume they mean developing in the open and accepting contributions to
be necessary ingredients to qualify a project as being in the spirit of
open source. I started to dig into it. I expected that we should
probably see references to these things all over the place when we look
up the term “open source”.

Oddly enough, Wikipedia doesn’t really talk about those things in its
[article on Open
Source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source "Open Source"), but
hey, it’s Wikipedia.

But oddly enough, there’s no mention of accepting contributions in the
[Open Source
Definition](http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd "Open Source") or pretty
much anywhere in [http://opensource.org/](http://opensource.org/) that I
could find. It doesn’t really address it.

Neither does any open source license have anything to say about the way
the software is developed or whether the project accepts contributions.

Let’s take a look at the Free Software Foundation which is opposed to
the term “Open Source” and might have a different [definition of free
software](http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html "Free Software").
I’m going to quote a small portion of this.

> Thus, “free software” is a matter of liberty, not price. To understand

> “free beer”.

> A program is free software if the program's users have the four

I looked for interviews from the pioneers of open source for more
information. Richard Stallman reiterates the same points [in this
interview](http://itmanagement.earthweb.com/osrc/article.php/3717476/Interview-with-Richard-Stallman-Four-Essential-Freedoms.htm "Software's Four Essential Freedoms").
What about [Eric Raymond](http://www.catb.org/~esr/ "Eric Raymond")?
Well he just links to [http://opensource.org/](http://opensource.org/).
As you can see, he’s the [President
Emeritus](http://opensource.org/ "Open Source Board") of the Open Source
Initiative (OSI) which created the OSD that I’ve been using as my
definition.

I then asked [Miguel De
Icaza](http://tirania.org/blog/ "Miguel De Icaza's blong") for his
thoughts. Miguel is a developer with [a long history in open
source](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Miguel_de_Icaza "Miguel on Wikipedia").
He started the GNOME and Mono projects and has more open source
experience in his pinky than I have in my entirety. He had some
interesting insights.

What gives?
-----------

Isn’t it odd that these concepts that we hold so dearly to as being part
of the spirit of open source aren’t mentioned by these stewards of open
source?

Maybe it’s because the essential ingredient to open source, the spirit
of open source, is not accepting contributions, it’s **freedom**.

The freedom to look at, remix, and redistribute source code without fear
of recrimination.

Even so, I still think accepting contributions and developing in the
open **are hugely important** to any open source project. If I didn’t
believe that, I wouldn’t be working at
[GitHub](http://github.com/ "GitHub").

I started to think that perhaps a more apt term to describe that process
is [**crowd
sourcing**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing "Crowd sourcing").
Crowd sourcing can provide many benefits, according to the article I
linked to:

> -   Problems can be explored at comparatively little cost, and often
>     very quickly.
> -   Payment is by results or even omitted.
> -   The organization can tap a wider range of talent than might be
>     present in its own organization.
> -   By listening to the crowd, organizations gain first-hand insight
>     on their customers' desires.
> -   The community may feel a brand-building kinship with the
>     crowdsourcing organization, which is the result of an earned sense
>     of ownership through contribution and collaboration.

But Miguel thought a better term is “open and collaborative
development.” That’s the process that is so closely associated with
developing open source software that it’s become synonymous with open
source in the minds of many people. But it’s not the same thing because
it’s possible to conduct open and collaborative development on a
non-open source project.

Splitting Hairs?
----------------

I know some folks will continue to think I’m splitting hairs, which is
an impressive feat if you think about it as I definitely don’t have the
hands of a surgeon and hairs are so thin.

One counter argument might be that perhaps the original framing of “open
source” was focused on freedoms, but what we refer to as open source
today has evolved to include crowd sourcing as an essential component.

I can see that. It seems obvious to me that collaborative development in
the open is a huge part of the culture surrounding open source. But
being a core part of the culture doesn’t necessarily mean it’s in the
spirit. A lot of people feel that drugs are a big part of the Burning
Man culture, for example, but I don’t think it’s an essential part of
its spirit. It’s the creativity and expression that forms the spirit of
Burning Man.

Who Cares About The License?
----------------------------

Another point someone made is that the community of contributors is more
beneficial than having an open source license. I addressed that point in
my last post, but Miguel had a great take on this, emphasis mine.

You could build the most open and collaborative project ever, but if the
source code isn’t under a license that meets the open source definition,
it may be possible for project to close shop and withdraw all your
rights to the code.

With OSS code, that’s just not possible. A copyright holder of the
source can close shop and stop giving you access to new addition they
write, but they can’t retroactively withdraw the license to code they’ve
already released under an OSI certified license.

And this is a real benefit, even with otherwised “closed” projects that
are open source. Miguel gave me one example in relation to Mono.

Prove me wrong?
---------------

By the way, I’m open to be proven wrong and changing my mind. Heck, I’ve
done it twice this week as Miguel convinced me that “Open Source” only
requires the license. But if you do disagree with me, I’d love to see
references that back up your point as opposed to unsubstantiated name
calling.

I think this topic is tricky because it’s very easy to discuss whether
software is licensed under an open source license. If we agree on the
open source definition, or the free software definition, you can easily
evaluate that yes, the software gives you the rights and freedoms
mentioned earlier.

But it’s trickier to create strict definitions of what encompasses the
spirit of anything, because people have different ideas around them. I
know some folks that feel that commercial software goes against the
spirit of open source. I tend to disagree pointing out that it’s the
license that matters, and whether or not you make money from the
software is tangential. But I digress.

I know I won’t convince everyone of my points. That’s fine. I enjoy a
healthy debate. The only thing I hope to convince you of is that even if
you disagree with me, that you can see I’ve provided good reasons for me
to believe what I do and it’s not out of being disingenuous.

Collaboration is Good
---------------------

In the end, I think it’s a huge benefit for any open source project to
develop in an open collaborative manner. When I think of open source
software, that’s the development model that comes first in my mind. But,
if you don’t follow that model (perhaps for good reasons, maybe for bad
reasons) but do license the software under an open source license, I
will still recognize your project as an open source project.
