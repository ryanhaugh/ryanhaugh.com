In Decemember I wrote about a great [soccer
camp](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/12/22/Soccer_Camp.aspx "Soccer Camp")
I attended. Well one of the other attendees is a Sports Anchor at
Univision and had a camera man in tow taking footage during the camp.

![Soccer Ball](http://haacked.com/images/SoccerBallBW.jpg)Starting on
Saturday, February 17^th^, Univision will be airing a four part series
about the Galaxy Camp. The second part will air on Sunday and the third
and fourth parts the following weekend.

Of course, this is subject to change without prior notice, but if you
tune in, you just might catch a glimpse of me on the tube.
Unfortunately, I didnâ€™t feel comfortable enough with my spanish to give
an interview like several of the other campers.

In Los Angeles, this would would be on KMEX channel 34.

*Disclaimer: I was once a Univision employee.*
