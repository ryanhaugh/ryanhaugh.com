I'm here in Seattle hooking an unsuspecting Dan Kalish on the drug I
call RSS Bandit. He just finished the Washington Bar (after having
passed the Connecticut bar only a couple of years ago. Sucks to be a
lawyer and move.) and is enjoying a quiet repose. This is my first
attempt to a non geek on RSS.
