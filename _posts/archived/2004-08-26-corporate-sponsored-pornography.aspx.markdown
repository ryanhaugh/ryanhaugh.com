I thought that would get your attention. I recently realized that my old
blog on blogspot is still up and running. When I was working at a large
ethnic television network (that will remain unnamed), I received the
following internal email:

> Due to performance issues with one of the email filters, I have been
> forced turn all but the most essential portions off. As a result of
> this change, there may be an increase in the amount of pornographic
> email that reaches you.

I suppose there will be a correlated drop in productivity.
