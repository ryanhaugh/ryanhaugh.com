ELMAH, *which stands for Error Logging Modules and Handlers for
ASP.NET*, is an open source project which makes it easy to log and view
unhandled exceptions via its pluggable architecture.

[![elmah](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Securely-Implement-ELMAH-For-Plug-And-Pl_94C5/elmah_thumb.png "elmah")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Securely-Implement-ELMAH-For-Plug-And-Pl_94C5/elmah_2.png)

Having been around a while, a lot has already been written on it so I
won’t rehash all that information. For more details, you can read the
following:

-   [Using HTTP Modules and Handlers to Create Pluggable ASP.NET
    Components](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa479332.aspx "The article that started it all")
-   [ELMAH page on Google
    Code](http://code.google.com/p/elmah/ "ELMAH on Google Code")

All you need to know for the purposes of this post is that ELMAH is
implemented as two key components:

-   An HTTP Module Used To Log Exceptions
-   An HTTP Handler for viewing Exceptions

In the sample *web.config* file that is included with the ELMAH
download, the HTTP handler is configured like so:

```csharp
<httpHandlers>
  <add verb="POST,GET,HEAD" path="elmah.axd" 
    type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah" />
</httpHandlers>
```

This allows you to view the error log from the URL
*[http://your-site/elmah.axd](http://your-site/elmah.axd)*. There’s one
big problem with this...**you do not want to deploy this to your
production site**.

This would allow any joker with a browser to view your exceptions and
potentially gain information that would allow someone to hack your site.

Personally, I think that the sample *web.config* should have `elmah.axd`
be secured by default. It’s quite easy to do. Here’s what I did:

First, I changed the HttpHandler section to look like this:

```csharp
<httpHandlers>
  <add verb="POST,GET,HEAD" path="/admin/elmah.axd" 
    type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah" />
</httpHandlers>
```

Notice that all I did was add *admin* to the `path` attribute.

I then added the following `location` element to my `web.config`.

```csharp
<!-- Deny unauthenticated users to see the elmah.axd -->
<location path="admin">
  <system.web>
    <authorization>
      <deny users="?"/>
    </authorization>
  </system.web>
</location>
```

**IMPORTANT:** It’s important to note that I’m securing everything in
the admin directory and that I’m making sure that elmah.axd is served
from the root */admin* URL. If the httpHandler “path” element was just
“admin/elmah.axd” or “elmah.axd” I could inadverdently expose Elmah
information.

Troy Hunt has [a great write-up of the perils of getting ELMAH
configuration
wrong](http://www.troyhunt.com/2012/01/aspnet-session-hijacking-with-google.html "ASP.NET Session Hijacking").
In his post he shows a more robust way to secure elmah.axd. Put the
httpHandlers section within the location section.

```csharp
<location path="elmah.axd">
  <system.web>
    <httpHandlers>
      <add verb="POST,GET,HEAD" path="elmah.axd" 
        type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah" />
    </httpHandlers>
    <authorization>
      <allow roles="Admin" />
      <deny users="*" />
    </authorization>
  </system.web>
  <system.webServer>
    <handlers>
      <add name="Elmah" path="elmah.axd" verb="POST,GET,HEAD"
        type="Elmah.ErrorLogPageFactory, Elmah"
        preCondition="integratedMode" />
    </handlers>
  </system.webServer>
</location>
```

To demonstrate this in action, I’ve created a solution containing a Web
Application project with ELMAH and authentication fully implemented.

The point of this sample app is to demonstrate how to set this all up.
So for example, the login page has a button to auto-log you in. In the
real world, you’d probably use a real login form. You can also change
the authentication from Forms authentication to Windows authentication
depending on your needs. That might make sense in many scenarios.

The app demonstrates in principle how to setup and secure the
*elmah.axd* page. If you have SQL Express installed, you should be able
to compile and run the demo without any extra steps to see ELMAH in
action.
