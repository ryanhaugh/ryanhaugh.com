![Photo of a
Drill](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/SoftwareTipsForHardwareMakers_EB2E/335381_propeller_drill_thumb1.jpg)We
often hear that the current state of software development is still
dysfunctional. Scott Rosenberg recently wrote a book to that effect
called [*Dreaming In
Code*](http://www.dreamingincode.com/ "Dreaming In Code website"). He
takes takes a look at the question *Why is software so hard*? According
to Scott, Software developement’s history is marred by poor quality,
missed deadlines, and cost overruns, primarily due to a persistent
dysfunctional culture.

And he’s talking about software written by companies who are in the
business ogf writing software. **Well if software written by software
companies is so bad, how bad is the software written by hardware
companies?**

Very bad.

I’m sure there are a few exceptions, but companies that I think should
know better write atrociously poor software. And frankly, I’m getting
tired of it. Here are some basic principles for hardware makers to keep
in mind when writing software for their products.

### 1. The computer belongs to me, not you!

Did you ever notice that my documents are in a folder named ***My**
Documents*. Not ***Your** Documents* (in Vista, it’s just *Documents*,
but there’s still an implicit *my* in there).

That means that folder belongs to me. Not you.

So I beg you, stop adding your folders in there. There is a proper
location for *your* stuff, in the *Application Data* directory. Since
you’re too lazy to understand how Windows works, I’ll write some
sample code for you in C\# that demonstrates where to place your
application’s files. I’m sure you can figure out the C++ equivalent.

```csharp
string appDataPath = Environment.GetFolderPath
  (Environment.SpecialFolder.ApplicationData);

string yourAppDataPath = 
  Path.Combine(appDataPath, "YourApplicationName");
if(!Directory.Exists(yourAppDataPath))
{
  Directory.CreateDirectory(yourAppDataPath);
}
```

Brush up on the
[Environment.SpecialFolder](http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.environment.specialfolder.aspx "Environment.SpecialFolder Enumeration Documentation on MSDN")
enumeration. It’ll come in handy.

For user settings and application cache data, you might also consider
using [Isolated
Storage](http://www.dotnetdevs.com/articles/IsolatedStorage.aspx "Understanding Isolated Storage").
Just don’t put it in *My Documents*.

### 2. Don’t Assume The User Is An Administrator

While I’m ranting on this topic, I should also mention that any data
your application needs to write should not go in the *Program Folders*
directory. Not everybody runs their machine as an administrator and
better you learn that lesson now than when Vista is widely disseminated.

### 3. Learn About the Platform And The Services It Provides You.

I recently bought a USB enabled Universal Power Supply (UPS) that was
well reviewed. It appears to be a great hardware product, but the
software is crap.

The point of getting a USB enabled UPS is that the UPS can shut down
windows gracefully if the power goes out. But rather than intergrating
cleanly with [Windows XP Power
Management](http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/pwrmn_ups_configure_ups.mspx?mfr=true "Configuring UPS with Windows XP"),
they wrote their own ugly little system tray applet. Why not take
advantage of what the OS provides?

To me, this example and the previous example I mentioned with the
*Application Data* folder belies a willful ignorance and disregard for
writing good software for Windows. It’s due to an unwillingness to take
the time to learn about the platform.

### 4. Honor Your Obligations and Promises.

When installing HP drivers and software for my scanner (which sadly
doesn’t work with Vista at all), the installation process provides me
with a checkbox “Add an HP Share-To-Web icon to the desktop?”.

I responded with my usual response, *Hell no*!, by unchecking the
checkbox. But what happens when the installation is complete? There’s
the icon on my desktop. Not only that, the icon is impossible to delete.
I mean **impossible**!

I tried to right click it, there’s no *delete* option. I click
*properties* and select *remove icon from desktop* and click *Apply*.
The dialog hangs, never returning. Fantastic!

Please, give users a choice. **And when they make a choice, honor it**!

### 5. We Really Don’t Want Your Cruft

Really. Seriously. We don’t.

It’s simple. If a piece of software is something we really want, we’ll
take the time to find it and install it. We don’t need you to install a
bunch of crapware alongside your drivers or main application.

**If it needs to be pork barreled in order to get it on our machines, we
probably don’t want it.**

Trust me on this one. The extra endorsement money you get for bundling
probably won’t make up for the loss in customer satisfaction.

### 6. If The Software Sucks, We Think The Hardware Sucks.

Again, quite simple. The majority of user interaction with a piece of
hardware is really via the software. If the software is clunky and hard
to use, or worse, just flat out fails to work. We associate the failure
with the entire product, hardware and all. **After all, if a company
can’t take the time to write quality software, why should we trust in
the quality of the hardware?**

### Conclusion

So that’s it. All I ask is that hardware makers take as much care
writing their software as they do building their hardware. Perhaps more
care, given how flimsy hardware can be these days.

When the supporting software is good, customers will rave about your
products.
