I’ve been following with interest
[Shelley’s](http://weblog.burningbird.net/) progress with WordForm, a
blogging engine. I hadn’t realized that WordForm was a fork in WordPress
until she recently mentioned it.

In [this particular
post](http://weblog.burningbird.net/archives/2005/06/02/the-programming-balancing-act/)
she describes some of the work she’s doing to handle metadata for
images. She’s extracting EXIF data from images and storing as RDF
statements in the database. She’s also pulling EXIF data from Flickr via
its RESTful API. This is some sweet stuff that I hope finds its way into
Subtext sometime in the future, though we have more pressing immediate
concerns.

I’ll just wait to see how it pans out for WordForm and we’ll STEAL STEAL
STEAL (of course giving full credit and props back to Shelley). ;)
