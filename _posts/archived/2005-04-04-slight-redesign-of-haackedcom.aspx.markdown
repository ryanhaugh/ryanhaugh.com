So I spent a bit of time today to "refresh" the look of my site. On the
face of it, it's not a dramatic change, but under the hood, I tore out
the table driven layout and replaced it with a CSS driven layout.

For you aggregator readers, [take a look](http://haacked.com/) and let
me know what you think?

And if it looks really wack, try a hard refresh (CTRL+F5) because the
stylesheet may be cached on your computer. If it still looks wack, try
drinking 6 beers in quick succession and let me know how it looks with
beer goggles on.

I should also mention it looks better in FireFox than IE.
