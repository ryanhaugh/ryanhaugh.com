My latest tech toy is an HP Scanjet 5530 Photosmart Scanner (wow that's
a mouthful). The defining feature of this scanner is the photo feeder
built in. Simply add a pile of photos (around 24 max at a time) into the
feeder, press a button, and go watch your Tivo'd episode of 24 while
your photos scan (it doesn't take all that long).

The incessant creaking of my bookshelf as it strains under the load of
my accumulated photos spurred me to purchase this scanner. Having
shuttled around the planet while growing up, it's important to me to
archive the memories of the havoc I created.

To that end, I also spent a lot of time searching for the perfect photo
organizational software. The ideal program would have a clean nice
interface and allow me to tag photos, organize photos into albums,
search with face and image recognition, and automatically fix bad
hair-day pics. I ended up purchasing Adobe Photoshop Album 2.0, which
I'm quite happy with, though it doesn't have image recognition (nobody
really does just yet) and won't fix my bad hair (a lost cause).

However, this new memo from Microsoft Research
![](/images/MicrosoftResearch.GIF) describes several advances that
Microsoft is working on that will make their way into future products.
Examples include image recognition, improved ability to fix red-eye and
cut people from one photo and paste into another. One neat feature that
currently works in Asian versions of Office 2003 can convert a picture
of a person into a cartoon character with pretty good resemblance.
Currently it only works for asian faces. I have to admit, I'm very
excited.
