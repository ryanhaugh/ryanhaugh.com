![Real Madrid](http://haacked.com/images/RealMadrid.jpg) Wohoo! The
little lady and myself will be in attendance as we watch [Zinedine
Zidane](http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma274.htm),
[Beckham](http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma433.htm),
[Ronaldo](http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma398.htm),
[Owen](http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma435.htm), [Roberto
Carlos](http://www.realmadrid.com/articulo/rma924.htm) and the rest of
Real Madrid completely overpower and dismantle the lackluster Galaxy
when they play an exhibition game at the Home Depot Center in Carson.

It’ll be interesting to see if Landon Donovan can scrape together a
worthy performance in the face of such talent and show that he’s ready
for the world stage.

I remember when living in Madrid, Spain just how revered Real Madrid is.
They are a storied team with a rich history and a fantastic roster this
year. Of course, too much star power can sometimes be a detriment, as we
learned with the lakers last year, and as we saw this year as second
place Real Madrid were upstaged by Barcelona for the Spanish League
title.
