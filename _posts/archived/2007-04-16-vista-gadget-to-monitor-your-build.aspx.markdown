[Simone Chiaretta](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz/ "Simone"), a member of
the [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext") team (not to mention
many other projects), just [released a Vista
Gadget](http://www.codeclimber.net.nz/archive/2007/04/17/Vista-Gadget-for-CruiseControl.NET---CC.NET-Monitor-for-Vista-Sidebar.aspx "Vista Sidebar Gadget")
which allows you to monitor a
[CruiseControl.NET](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNET/Welcome+to+CruiseControl.NET "CruiseControl.NET")
build within your sidebar.

It looks spiffier than the system tray applet that comes with CCNET.

Here’s a screenshot of it docked.

And undocked.

From the screenshots you can see the status of the projects he is
monitoring. The good news is that the [1.9
build](http://build.subtextproject.com/ccnet/ViewFarmReport.aspx "Subtext Build Server")
has been fixed since he took these screenshots.

Pretty nifty!
