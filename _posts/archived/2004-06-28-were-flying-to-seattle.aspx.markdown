![](/images/seattle.jpg)And I expect my arms to be tired (ba-dump
pshhh).

We're heading over there on July 28 to see my wife's best friend (from
back when they lived in Japan) and her husband.  She's working on her
residency at some hospital somewhere over there (I know so much). How's
the weather been up there? Being a transplanted Alaskan, I'm a big fan
of the Northwest. I expect that the days will be nice and long. 

It's been a long time since I've been up to Seattle. Any
recommendations?
