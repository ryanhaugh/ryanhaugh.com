Microsoft recently released [Windows Live Writer Beta
2](http://writer.live.com/ "Windows Live Writer"), the long awaited next
version of their blog editing tool. Although there are a *[few
quirks](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/14/WindowsLiveWriterFirstImpression.aspx "First Impression of Windows Live Writer")*
with WLW, I find the user interface and usability to be really nice.
They make great use of the right sidebar panel.

In their latest release, they’ve introduced a few more extensibility
points including a Manifest, which allows you to have a branded weblog
panel. More than just for cosmetic reasons, this will help those who
manage more than one blog see in an instant which blog they are editing.

It looks like WLW is positioning to be the rich client interface into
your blog, a direction I like.

[Barry Dorrans](http://idunno.org/ "idunno.rog - Barry’s Blog") just
[posted a
manifest](http://idunno.org/archive/2007/06/03/simple-windows-live-writer-manifest-for-subtext.aspx "Simple Windows Live Writer Manifest for Subtext")
on his blog for [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project")
based on the one [Tim
Heuer](http://www.timheuer.com/blog/ "Method ~ of ~ failed - Tim’s Blog")
deployed [to his own
blog](http://www.timheuer.com/blog/archive/2007/05/30/14110.aspx "New Windows Live Writer Avail").

You can download the manifest from Barry’s blog. He also committed it to
our Subversion repository, so it will be included in the next version of
Subtext.

Subtext remains committed to providing a great experience when using
Windows Live Writer with a Subtext blog. We were quick to support
[Really Simple Discovery
(RSD)](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/08/15/WhatIsReallySimpleDiscoveryRSD.aspx "What is Really Simple Discovery?")
and the
[newMediaObject](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi#metaweblognewmediaobject "newMediaObject method")
method of the [MetaWeblog
API](http://www.xmlrpc.com/metaWeblogApi "MetaWeblog API"). We’ll work
hard on providing first class support for adding and deleting
categories.

I have an open question for the WLW team. **Is there a community officer
I should be in communications with to get a heads up on future features
that might require changes to the Subtext in order to provide first
class support?** I am wondering if this information was available
somewhere and maybe I just missed it somehow. I would love to provide
advanced feedback and that sort of thing if you are interested. Consider
it an open offer. ;)

Now if we could just get WLW to support search and replace in their HTML
editor, I’d be much happier.
