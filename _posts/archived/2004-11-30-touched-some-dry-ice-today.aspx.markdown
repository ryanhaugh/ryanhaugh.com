Ouch that smarts!

During my flight today a bag of ice fell off the cart the flight
attendant's were pushing up the aisle. Thinking it was a simple bag of
ice, I picked up the ice and put it back in the bag. As I was holding
the ice, I realized that it was much colder than normal ice. Much much
colder. So cold in fact, it burned a bit.

Not to worry though, those long cold winters in Alaska prepared me for
such cold. I'm impervious to it. Except in L.A. for some reason, when
it's cold there, I'm succeptible.
