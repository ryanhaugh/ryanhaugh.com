Well maybe not all of you. For example, I know
[Jayson](http://jaysonknight.com/blog/ "Jayson Knight") isn’t going.
Sucker. (Oooh, I just *had* to rub it in, didn’t I?). ;)

For you others that are going, I know there a few people I hope to meet
because you promised to buy me a beer, or did I promise to buy you one?
Here are the lists of people I plan to see:

### Buying Me Beer

-   [Jeff](http://codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff Atwood's Blog")
-   [Joe](http://www.theaccidentalgeek.com/ "Joe Brinkman's Blog")
-   [Andy](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford "Andy Stopford")

### I’m Buying

-   [Adam Kinney](http://adamkinney.com/ "Adam Kinney's Blog")
-   [Erik Porter](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter/ "Erik Porter's Blog")

### No Exchange of Beer, Just Saying Hello

-   [Rob](http://weblogs.asp.net/rhoward/ "Rob Howard's Blog")
-   [Scott](http://scottwater.com/blog/ "Scott Watermasysk")

Normally, when I go to a conference like this, packing is a last minute
afterthought. But this time, I will plan one specific article of
clothing for the first day of the conference. I’ll wear a retina
scarring bright orange Aloha shirt so that those of you who owe me a
beer can easily spot me. If I owe you a beer, I will be wearing green
and I have blonde hair. Ignore the rest of this post.

Just look for the guy who looks like a [cross between Kim Jong Il and
Samuel
Schmid](/archive/2006/02/08/FaceRecognitionThatIsJustWrongOnSoManyLevels.aspx "Terrible Face Recognition").
You can probably find me at the Craps or the Blackjack tables. Maybe, if
things are going well, I might have a date with destiny at the *Let It
Ride* tables. Assuming she still works there.

And of course, if time permits, I will be at some of the sessions.
