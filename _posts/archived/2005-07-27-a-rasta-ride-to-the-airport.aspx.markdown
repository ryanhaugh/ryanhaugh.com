![Rastafarian Flag](http://haacked.com/images/RastafariFlag.jpg)For
those of you who give a damn, we made it safely to Japan. The trip
itself had quite an interesting start in the form of a cab ride to the
airport with a, ahem, slightly odd-in-the-head fellow.

It started off innocuously enough as we called a cab to take us to the
airport. When the driver called to let us know he was outside, we
hurried out looking for the cab, but had difficulty finding it. We then
noticed this dark Suburban pull out and the driver gruffly barked that
we needed to come over to the other side. Gee, it should have been
obvious to look for a dark Suburban, as opposed to, say, a bright yellow
or green vehicle.

Nonetheles, he lightened up as he put Akumi’s suitcase in the back. It
had a red, yellow, and green striped band around it which he loved. When
we stepped in the car, it became apparent why, the back of the front
seats were covered in laminated Rastafarian writings, the kind you might
pick up in Venice beach. This guy was a
[Rastafarian](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rastafari). You know, a
movement of Jah people.

As we stepped into the vehicle, I noticed some political material as
well, such as a picture of Bush and the Saudi Crown Prince hand in hand
next to a poem about how the author dreamed he ran into two devils
holding hands. Odd to have such religious and political writings all
over the back of a cab, but hey, it’s Los Angeles! In any case, once he
started playing some Reggae, my trepidations were put at ease as I
relaxed to the rasta beat, intent on enjoying the ride.

However, that only lasted a few minutes. He started furiously shuffling
through a huge pile of CDs in the midst of driving. He seemed to find
what he was looking for without hitting anybody, and started playing
some instrumental reggae. At this point, he *started singing out loud,
filling in the missing words to the music!*

Ok, I consider myself a very tolerant and understanding person, but this
came across as a bit odd, even for Los Angeles. But hey, they man was
feeling it, so we sat back and tried to relax again and enjoy the ride.
The only problem was as we pulled onto the freeway, the driver got more
and more into the music. He started pounding out the drum beats on the
panel between his seat and the shotgun seat. He turned up the music and
sang louder, gesticulating wildly with his right hand in the mode of a
rapper feeling the flow.

His song selection began with repeating...

> Jah Rastafari, he is my sheperd. Jah Rastafari, he is my sheperd...

...transitioning into such favorite classics as...

> Why why why why why **Why** why? We have no social security. We have
> no social justice. Social inequality. How much longer? Why why why why
> **Why** why...
>
> He was briefly interrupted by a phone call in which he had to relay a
> phone number for a customer in his Jamaican drawl that the customer
> had trouble understanding. He soon grew impatient and exclaimed, “Do
> you want me ta drive over tere ta write it down for you?” (imagine
> Jamaican accent). He then repeated the number and said, "I hope you
> got it." \*click\*.
>
> He soon resumed the show, ending the trip on...
>
> > True Love. True Love. True Love. I will love you tenderly. I will
> > love you Sincerely. I will love you gently. A love that is
> > transparent....

> At this point, I looked over at Akumi and she had lost it. The entire

> rear view mirror, I struggled with great effort to keep it together.
> This guy is driving us rapidly down a Los Angeles Freeway and seems a
> bit loose in the head. I don’t want to piss him off.

> What put us over the edge wasn’t just that he was singing. I seriously

> I’ll share it sometime.
