A while ago [Patrick
Cauldwell](http://www.cauldwell.net/patrick/blog/ "Patrick Cauldwell's Blog")
highlighted [a wonderful
technique](http://www.cauldwell.net/patrick/blog/PermaLink,guid,e9a1451b-108c-4da7-8be9-2b6c2316f7b1.aspx "Testing With External Files")
of using embedded resources for unit testing with external files.

Fully on board with Pat, I’ve applied that technique to client script
blocks when building web controls and ASP.NET pages.

How often have you written (or had to deal with) crap like this.

```csharp
string script = "<script language=\"javascript\">"
  + "function SomeFunction(someParam)" + Environment.NewLine
  + "{" + Environment.NewLine
  + "    alert(’Man, this sucks!’);" + Environment.NewLine
  + "}" + Environment.NewLine
  + "</script>";
```

A preferred approach is to have your client script code in a separate
file. For web controls, I generally have a folder named Resources that
contains a folder named Scripts. I’ll add my client script files there
as embedded resources. In figure 1 below, you can see that I have two
script files in my project.

![Embedded Scripts](/images/EmbeddedScripts.gif)\
 **Figure 1** Script files.

To make sure these files are compiled as embedded resources, I select
the files and set the build action to *embedded resource* in the
Properties window as in figure 2.

![Embedded Resource](/images/BuildActionEmbeddedResource.gif) \
 **Figure 2** Build Action = Embedded Resource.

Now when I need to display these scripts in a page, I can use the
following code which makes use of my handy dandy ScriptHelper class.

```csharp
if(!Page.IsClientScriptBlockRegistered("PairedDropDownHandler"))
{
  string script = ScriptHelper.UnpackScript("PairedDropDown.js");
  Page.RegisterClientScriptBlock("PairedDropDownHandler", script);
}
```

The contents of my embedded script files do not contain the \<script\>
tags. I leave that responsibility to my ScriptHelper class so that these
script files can be used as stand alone script files as well. The code
for my script helper class is below.

```csharp
/// <summary>
/// Utility class for extracting embedded scripts.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Uses a naming convention. All scripts should be placed 
/// in the Resources\Scripts folder. The scriptName is just 
/// the filename of the script.
/// </remarks>
public static class ScriptHelper
{
  /// <summary>
  /// Returns the contents of the embedded script as
  /// a stringwrapped with the start / end script tags.
  /// </summary>
  /// <param name="scriptName">FileName of the script.</param>
  /// <returns>Contents of the script.</returns>
  public static string UnpackScript(string scriptName)
  {
    string language = "javascript";
    string extension = Path.GetExtension(scriptName);
  
    if(0 == string.Compare(extension, ".vbs", true
      , CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))
    {
      language = "vbscript";
    }
        
    return UnpackScript(scriptName, language);
  }

  public static string UnpackScript(string scriptName, string scriptLanguage)
  {
    return "<script language=\"Javascript\">"
      + Environment.NewLine
      + UnpackEmbeddedResourceToString("Resources.Scripts." + scriptName)
      + Environment.NewLine
      + "</script>";
  }
 
  // Unpacks the embedded resource to string.
  static string UnpackEmbeddedResourceToString(string resourceName)
  {
    Assembly executingAssembly = Assembly.GetExecutingAssembly();
    Stream resourceStream = executingAssembly
      .GetManifestResourceStream(typeof(ScriptHelper), resourceName);
    using(StreamReader reader = new StreamReader(resourceStream, Encoding.ASCII))
    {
      return reader.ReadToEnd();
    }
  }
}
```

You’ll be seeing this ScriptHelper class again when I highlight some
controls you might find useful. If you’re already using ASP.NET 2.0 (aka
Whidbey), there’s an even [better way to handle client
files](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnvs05/html/webresource.asp "Web Resource Handler").

UPDATE: I just realized I was using code from a `StringHelper` class I
wrote. I updated that bit to inline the simple functionality.
