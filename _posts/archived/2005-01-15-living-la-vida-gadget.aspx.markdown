I love me some electronic gadgets.

Take today for example, I was in the middle of a fantastic pick-up
soccer game under clear blue skies when I received a page on the company
Treo (I had it by the goal). A socket server service was down and needed
to be restarted (long story, it will get replaced by something yours
truly wrote).

A few years ago that probably would have required me muttering a litany
of swear words under my breath while driving in to restart the
malcontent service. But not this time baby! We live in the digitial
wireless mini-this and mini-that age.

I took over as goalie for a bit, busted out the Treo, navigated to our
secure administration tool on the web, and restarted that sucker (all
while blocking a few deadly shots on goal). Life is good.
