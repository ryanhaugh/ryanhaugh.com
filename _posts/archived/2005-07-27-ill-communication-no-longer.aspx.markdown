You just have to love modern technology and its power to shrink the
Earth. I had a meeting over Skype with Micah in San Francisco from here
in Japan with no discernible lag at all and wonderful audio quality.
Later, I had an MSN Messenger chat conference about RSS Bandit with
[Torsten](http://www.rendelmann.info/blog/) in Germany and
[Dare](http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/) in Nigeria. What a small
world indeed!

Please excuse me as I go over to Google Earth, zoom out, and use my
mouse pointer to spin the globe.
