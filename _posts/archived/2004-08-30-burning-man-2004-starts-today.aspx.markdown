So today, loads of clean people will be driving through the small town
of Gerlach into the temporary city of Black Rock City. Trust me, they
won't stay clean for long, and will definitely bring home a souvenir of
a nice coating of Playa dust over everything.

They are there to begin a week long festival known as [Burning
Man](http://www.burningman.com/). This year's theme is "Vault Of
Heaven". I believe my friends Ed and Michael (not Krimm) are going to be
out there getting into all sorts of trouble.

I hope you all have a good time out there and be safe. Especially watch
out for the sharks!
