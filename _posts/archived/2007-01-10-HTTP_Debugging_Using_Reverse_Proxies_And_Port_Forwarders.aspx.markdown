[![Image of a RIM Blackberry
emulator](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingFiddlerAsAReverseProxy_D572/Blackberryemulator_thumb3.png)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingFiddlerAsAReverseProxy_D572/Blackberryemulator5.png)I’m
currently working on an interesting project to develop a series of HTTP
services used by games running on the RIM Blackberry. These services
will enable players to compete against one another (though not in real
time) in various games and see high scores, challenge friends, etc....
It brings a social aspect to gaming on your blackberry device.

The games are written in Java and I’m using a Blackberry emulator for
testing the interaction between the game and the services. I’m running
the service at localhost on my local machine to allow me to step through
the debugger when necessary.

With all these web requests and response shuttling back and forth
between the game and the service, it’d be nice to be able to debug that
HTTP traffic using a network analyzer
like [Fiddler](http://www.fiddlertool.com/ "Fiddler Homepage").

### What Is Fiddler?

If you’re not familiar with Fiddler, it acts as a local HTTP Proxy on
port 8888 allowing you to inspect HTTP traffic between your an
application and a web application (even one [running at
localhost](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000590.html "Localhost Http Debugging")).
WinINET-based applications (such as Internet Explorer) automatically use
Fiddler when its running. For other applications, you need to configure
the application to use Fiddler as a proxy.

It’s immensely useful when debugging web services and weird problems
with web applications.

### It Wasn’t Working For Me

Unfortunately, I ran into an annoying problem. The emulator is not a
WinINET-based application nor does it allow configuring a proxy, thus
Fiddler was not reporting any traffic.

### Configuring Fiddler as a Reverse Proxy

Fortunately, I found instructions on the Fiddler site that shows you how
to [configure Fiddler as a Reverse
Proxy](http://www.fiddlertool.com/Fiddler/help/reverseproxy.asp "Using Fiddler as a Reverse Proxy").

A [reverse
proxy](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy "Reverse Proxy on Wikipedia")
sits in front of your webserver and forwards requests on to your
webserver. Thus the application doesn’t need to be configured to use it.
All I had to do was ask the developers to change the application to make
requests for port 8888 (I’ll explain later why I couldn’t just set up a
HOSTS file entry).

I then added a rule to forward requests for localhost port 8888 to
localhost port 80 like so:

if (oSession.host.toLowerCase() == "localhost:8888") \
    oSession.host = "localhost:80";

Unfortunately, this didn’t work, creating some weird infinite loop when
I would make a request to localhost:8888. To rectify this, I added an
entry to the HOSTS file to map the hostname *MOBILE* to the ip address
127.0.0.1. Fiddler apparently doesn’t work as a simple port forwarder
(I’ve got a solution for that, keep reading).

[![Image depicting a hosts file. The last entry shows the ip address
127.0.0.1 mapped to the host name
'Mobile'](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingFiddlerAsAReverseProxy_D572/hostsfileinnotepad_thumb10.png)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/UsingFiddlerAsAReverseProxy_D572/hostsfileinnotepad16.png)

I then updated the custom rule in Fiddler to route requests for
mobile:8888 to port 80 of the localhost and again asked the developers
to change the url encoded in the app (I don’t have the source for the
client app).

if (oSession.host.toLowerCase() == "mobile:8888") \
    oSession.host = "localhost:80";

Now I can monitor requests from the emulator to localhost using Fiddler.
One benefit of using Fiddler is that I can replay requests tweaking form
values and such.

### Dealing With Hard-Coded URLs

In the most recent build of the game, the game developers accidentally
changed the hard-coded URL to point back to the QA environment. For the
sake of this example, suppose it is
[http://mobile.example.com/](http://mobile.example.com/).

Rather than asking them once again to change it, I decided to try and
work around this. I added the QA server hostname to the HOSTS file just
like I did with *MOBILE* before, pointing it to localhost. I then had
to change IIS on my machine to run on a different port, since I planned
to configure TcpTrace to listen in on port 80. I chose the perennial
favorite alternate port for IIS, port 8080. and used
[TcpTrace](http://www.pocketsoap.com/tcptrace/ "TcpTrace") to listen on
port 80 and forward requests to port 8080.

[![Image of TcpTrace window forwarding requests for port 80 to

This allowed me to view the HTTP traffic back and forth between the
emulator and the web service again using TcpTrace. Unfortunately, I
could not get Fiddler to work in this setup, so I lost some of the
ability to tweak and replay requests. This ended up being fine since the
latest build is meant for final testing.
