I recently moved my blog off of
[WebHost4Life](http://webhost4life.com/ "Web Host 4 Life Website") where
I have had it hosted for a couple years now. Apparently the traffic on
my blog was causing a load on their servers. I never fully believed it
was my blog’s fault since they didn’t give me any convincing evidence.

In any case, it is a fitting time to move it to my
[company’s](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT Website") dedicated server (at
[1and1](http://1and1.com/ "1 and 1 Website")) and my blog is now
blazingly fast compared to before. I figure rather than paying WH4L for
hosting, I might as well pay my own company for the privilege.

I switched DNS over and so far no problems. In case you are wondering, I
use [ZoneEdit.com](http://zoneedit.com/ "Zone Edit DNS") for my DNS
servers. They are a free DNS provider and I have not had any problems
with them at all. Very simple to set up and use.

The key benefit of having all my DNS over there is that everytime I
change hosting provider, I don’t have to change the root DNS servers at
my Domain Registrar.

Since I have already paid for a year at WH4L, I will probably set up a
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") blog for
my younger brother and some of his friends there.
