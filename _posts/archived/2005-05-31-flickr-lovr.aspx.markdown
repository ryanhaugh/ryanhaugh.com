I know it’s been around a good while now and has been the darling of the
blogging community far that time, but I only recently started to play
with [Flickr](http://flickr.com/). My initial resistance was due to my
complete dissatisfaction with other online photo management tools such
as oFoto, Yahoo Photos, SnapFish etc...

However, after spending only a few moments with Flickr, I can see that
Flickr has put a lot of thought into photo management in an effort to
get it right. It’s so good that I am reconsidering whether I even need a
desktop photo management software. I probably won’t give up Photoshop
Album just yet since I don’t want EVERY photo online. Besides, you never
know when a company will go out of business, taking my photos with it.
However my top feature request for the next version is Flickr
integration.

I’ve been emailing some friends trying to get them to join. My photos
are located at
[http://flickr.com/photos/haacked/](http://flickr.com/photos/haacked/).
Feel free to add your own tags if you have relevant information.

There are two things I love about Flickr so far, its social tagging
format (I can allow anyone to add tags to my photos, rather than trying
to organize everything myself and I can add tags to my friends' photos)
and its API. I haven’t played with the API directly, but the fact that
there are some [really cool tools](http://flickr.com/tools/) for
uploading photos quickly and easily is evidence that they’ve really
thought through how to let others extend Flickr.

So give it a shot, and try not to waste too much playing with it when
you should be working.
