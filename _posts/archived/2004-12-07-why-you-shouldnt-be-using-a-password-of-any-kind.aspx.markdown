[Robert Hensing](http://weblogs.asp.net/robert_hensing/), a senior
member of Microsoft's PSS Security Response Team, writes this
enlightening post [why
passwords](http://weblogs.asp.net/robert_hensing/archive/2004/07/28/199610.aspx)
are so 5 minutes ago.

For you non-techies, the short answer is that you should be using pass
phrases instead. For example, you might use a pass-phrase such as "my
computer is secure!" or "just a cheeseburger in paradise". The basic
premise is that short passwords are easily hacked even when using
non-standard symbols such as "p@\$\$w0rd". Hacking tools are now
sophisticated enough to deal with these type of passwords.
