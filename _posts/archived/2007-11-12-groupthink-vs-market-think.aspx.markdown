In his book, [The Wisdom of Crowds: Why the Many Are Smarter Than the
Few and How Collective Wisdom Shapes Business, Economies, Societies and
Nations](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385721706?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385721706 "The Wisdom of Crowds on Amazon.com")
(*title long enough for you?)*, James Surowiecki argues that decisions
made by a crowd are generally better than those made by any single
individual in the group.

Seems like a lot of theoretical hogwash until you see this thesis put to
action in the real world via a [prediction
market](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market "Prediction Market on Wikipedia").
A prediction market (also called a decision market) is, as its name
implies, a market created specifically to predict the likelihood of a
specific outcome. They are most successful when participants have
something invested in their decisions. Money often does the trick, but
is not necessary.

[The Hollywood Stock
Exchange](http://www.hsx.com/ "Hollywood Stock Exchange"), a prediction
market focused around the film industry, demonstrated the potential
accuracy of such markets when it went 32 for 39 in predicting 2006’s
Oscar Nominees (in the major categories that are the only ones people
care about). They didn’t [do so bad in
2007](http://www.midasoracle.org/2007/02/27/oscars-2007-hollywood-stock-exchange-bingo/ "Hollywood Stock Exchange goes 7 for 8")
either.

It’s no surprise then that there is a lot of research going on in
predictive markets. Preliminary results show they seem to work very well
when properly structured.

Contrast the success of prediction markets to another decision making
process that involves a group. A recent comment by a reader got me
thinking on this subject as he described one of the symptoms of this
process.

> If you try to satisfy all parties, you’ll end up with mediocre product
> that does not satisfy everybody.

An even more strong way to state this is to say that trying to satisfy
everyone leaves almost everyone unsatisfied.

This is one typical result of a decision making process known as
[*Groupthink*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Groupthink "Group Think on Wikipedia").
Another colorful term used to describe it is *decision by committee*.
These terms do not, by any means, have a positive connotation.

[![Group
Think](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/GroupThinkVsMarketThink_F2B3/group-think_thumb.gif)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/GroupThinkVsMarketThink_F2B3/group-think_2.gif) 

There seems to be a paradox here between the power of markets and the
ineptitude of Group Think. Why do these two somewhat similar means of
decision making have such a wide variance in accuracy?

Perhaps counter-intuitively, it has a lot to do with the **coercive
effects of seeking consensus** in decision making. Group think is often
hamstrung by seeking consensus whereas participants in an effective
market are largely independent of one another.

Before I continue, let me head off that insightful comment on how I am
trying to promote anarchy and save your fingers the pain of some typing
by pointing out that **this is not an indictment of all consensus driven
decision making**. In many cases, consensus is absolutely required. It
doesn't help if a decision is *optimal* but nobody is willing to
participate in the result of the decision. This sort of decision making
is especially essential in one particular form of decision making -
*negotiations,*which is well covered by the book [Getting to Yes:
Negotiating Agreement Without Giving
In](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0140157352?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0140157352 "Getting to Yes on Amazon").

The problem lies in applying negotiation to make decisions that should
not be made by consensus. At least not without applying non-consensus
based fact gathering first, so that negotiations can occur using data
gathered in a dispassionate manner.

So what makes groupthink particularly inadequate? Social psychologist
Irving Janis identified the following [eight symptoms of
groupthink](http://www.psysr.org/groupthink%20overview.htm "What is groupthink")
that hamstring good decision making:

1.  **Illusion of invulnerability** – Creates excessive optimism that
    encourages taking extreme risks.
2.  **Collective rationalization** – Members discount warnings and do
    not reconsider their assumptions.
3.  **Belief in inherent morality** – Members believe in the rightness
    of their cause and therefore ignore the ethical or moral
    consequences of their decisions.
4.  **Stereotyped views of out-groups** – Negative views of “enemy” make
    effective responses to conflict seem unnecessary.
5.  **Direct pressure on dissenters** – Members are under pressure not
    to express arguments against any of the group’s views.
6.  **Self-censorship** – Doubts and deviations from the perceived group
    consensus are not expressed.
7.  **Illusion of unanimity** – The majority view and judgments are
    assumed to be unanimous.
8.  **Self-appointed ‘mindguards’** – Members protect the group and the
    leader from information that is problematic or contradictory to the
    group’s cohesiveness, view, and/or decisions.

One symptom not listed here, but probably fits in with \#6 is the fear
of causing offense.

One theme in common in the list is that many of these symptoms are the
result of seeking some form of consensus with others within the group.
The net effect is that all of these symptoms provide incentives not to
deviate from the group.

**Prediction Markets counter these symptoms through independence and
proper incentive**. Because the participants in a market are not
directly working together, there is no way for peer pressure to burrow
itself into the decision making process. There is no fear of offending
others in such a market. Putting something valuable (such as money) on
the line (or having a huge investment in the correct outcome, such as
predicting disaster) has an eye-opening habit of making people truthful
and helps to avoid self-censorship etc...

Another necessary factor in the success of markets, as pointed out in an
insightful comment to this post, is **diversity**. Markets and
committees that lack diversity of viewpoint fail to take advantage of
all available information in a meaningful way and succumb to a form of
tunnel vision. This type of phenomena is very evident in a leader who
surrounds him/herself with sycophants and thus makes decisions based on
what they want to hear rather than fact.

Prediction markets are not perfect and are not suitable for all
decisions. In fact, they are probably not suitable for most decisions as
the cost to set up a market isn’t justified for everyday decisions like
whether you should get the bottle of beer or the pitcher of sangria.

However, understanding what makes predictive markets work and what the
symptoms of groupthink look like can be a great benefit the next time
you are making a decision within a group and start to see groupthink
emerging.
