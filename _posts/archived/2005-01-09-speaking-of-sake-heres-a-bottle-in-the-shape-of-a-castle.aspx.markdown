Due to my love for sake, my father-in-law gave this bottle to me as a
parting gift.

He also gave me two bottles of "Negori" Sake (not pictured). This is a
milky looking sake that contains the live cultures used in the sake
making process. I absolutely love it, but I learned that it's more of a
commoners drink and not served in many of the fine restaurants.

Now I just need some people to share it with when I get back to LA.
