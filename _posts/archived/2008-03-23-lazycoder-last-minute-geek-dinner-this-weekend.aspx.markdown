[LazyCoder](http://www.lazycoder.com/weblog/ "LazyCoder") (aka Scott
Koon) is organizing a little drinky drink this Wednesday around 6:00
PM-ish at [The Three Lions
Pub](http://thethreelionspub.com/thethreelionspub.htm "The Three Lions Pub").
This is just an informal gathering, not the huge production like the
[Hanselman](http://hanselman.com/blog/ "Scott Hanselman") Geek Dinner
which requires eating at a mall food court because some three hundred
plus geeks show up. (*Did you know his last geek dinner was covered by
the*[*Seattle Times
online*](http://blog.seattletimes.nwsource.com/brierdudley/2007/09/hanselman_in_town_for_seattle_1.html "Hanselman In Town")*?*).

No, this will be a smaller intimate affair. Here’s your chance to get me
sloshed by buying me beers in order to slip your pet feature into
ASP.NET MVC. If it’s a really crazy feature idea, you may have to move
up to Scotch. ;)

Seriously though, if you’re looking to blow off some steam on a Wed
night (aren’t we all?) swing by and throw back one or a few with us.
