I swear I never do [these stupid
quizzes](http://www.intertwingly.net/blog/2005/05/18/Blogging-3-questions)
or memes or whatever you call it, but this is only three questions. If
it’s good enough for Sam Ruby, it’s good enough for me.

1.  *Why did you begin blogging and what motivates you to blog today?*

    I started before it was called blogging as a way for my family and
    friends to keep tabs on me. I was basically rubbing it in that I was
    in sunny Los Angeles while my family and friends suffered the bitter
    cold of an Alaskan winter. What motivates me today is [fame, fortune
    and vanity](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/1322.aspx)! Though
    the first two still elude me, what really motivates me are these
    great relationships and conversations I’ve had online. Blogging
    spurred me to get involved in open source software and provides a
    steady stream of alternate viewpoints.

2.  *What tips can you offer to others who want to start blogging or
    improve their existing blog?*

    I think Sam says it well enough. I’ll only add, don’t take yourself
    too seriously and have fun with it. Write for yourself first, and
    others second. Thus if blogging ends up being just a fad (I don’t
    think it is), what would you care as you’ve improved your writing
    skills, had an outlet of expression, and made many interesting
    contacts along the way. Not to mention the fame and fortune that
    most certainly is yours.

3.  *What are three blogs that you read daily and why?*

    Did you say three, or three hundred? If I tried to only list three,
    I’d start to sound like an incoherent academy award winner stepping
    over the alloted time thanking countless friends and feigning worry
    about those little people I might offend. I started off with a small
    list and it just seemed to grow organically. Person A, whom I
    respect, mentions person B alot, so I link to person B. I often
    subscribe to people who link to my site (because they obviously have
    good taste) or comment on my site, and then drop them if they start
    to bore me. I really need to cut down on my list. But since you
    asked, three that come to mind are...
