Today I was thinking about how much I enjoy doing business with a
particular company and realized my natural inclination was not to blog
about it. Yet when a company really drops the ball, I have no problem
airing my criticisms. I don’t know about you, but I don’t like to be
around people who are only critical and never offer praise. It gets to
be tiresome.

So today I would like to give a shout out to
[Paychex](http://www.paychex.com/ "Paychex") (I am not in any way
affiliated with them other than being a customer). We signed up with
them to handle our payroll and everything has been extremely smooth. We
had a few problems (not related to them) when we initially started and
they went way above and beyond to help us straighten our books related
to payroll.

Not only that, the *payroll specialist* who handles our account is
extremely courteous and helpful on the phone. Just an all around cool
guy. It is very telling when you are looking forward to calling in
payroll because you like talking to the rep. Paychex just seems to
understand customer service and gets it right.

So tell me, who deserves your shout out today?
