Not too long ago I announced that my wife and I are [expecting a
baby](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/05/World_Domination_Phase_1_Commenced.aspx "World Domination Plans")
this year as part of our world domination plans. Adding fuel to our
plans is the discovery that this year is a special year according to the
Chinese Zodiac.

It is not only the year of the Pig, it is the **Year of the Golden
Pig**. According to Chinese Folklore, this is an event that occurs once
in every 600 years and will ensure that a baby born on this year will
experience a prosperous and wealthy life.

This legend is so popular, that Korea is expected to have a 10% increase
in birth rate this year, which is apparently much needed as its [birth
rate is extremely
low](http://uk.news.yahoo.com/08052006/323/south-korea-s-birth-rate-lowest-record.html "South Korea Birth Rate at Lowest").

I’m not going to start taking loans against my child's future wealth
just yet as many Chinese foklorists and historians [doubt this
belief](http://world.kbs.co.kr/english/town/town_seoultoday_detail.htm?No=296 "Golden Pig Doubts").

Well I have a thought for you Joo Young-ha. Quit raining on our parade!
Perhaps the Year of the Golden Pig happens every 600 years *from now*.
