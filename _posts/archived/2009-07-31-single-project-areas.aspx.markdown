**UPDATE***This post is now obsolete. Single project areas are a core
part of ASP.NET MVC 2.*

Preview 1 of ASP.NET MVC 2 introduces the concept of Areas. Areas
provide a means of dividing a large web application into multiple
projects, each of which can be developed in relative isolation. The goal
of this feature is to help manage complexity when developing a large
site by factoring the site into multiple projects, which get combined
back into the main site before deployment. Despite the multiple
projects, it’s all logically one web application.

One piece of feedback I’ve already heard from several people is that
they don’t want to manage multiple projects and simply want areas
within  single project as a means of organizing controllers and views
much [like I had it in my
prototype](http://haacked.com/archive/2008/11/04/areas-in-aspnetmvc.aspx "Grouping Controllers")
for ASP.NET MVC 1.0.

![areas-folder-structure](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/36ef165d4ea4_ED92/areas-folder-structure_6.png "areas-folder-structure")

Well the bad news is that the areas layout I had in that prototype
doesn’t work right out of the box. The good news is that it is very easy
to enable that scenario. All of the components necessary are in the box,
we just need to tweak the installation slightly.

We’ve added a few area specific properties to
`VirtualPathProviderViewEngine`, the base class for our
`WebFormViewEngine` and others. Properties such as
`AreaViewLocationFormats` allow specifying an array of format strings
used by the view engines to locate a view. The default format strings
for areas doesn’t match the structure that I used before, but it’s not
hard for us to tweak things a bit so it does.

The approach I took was to simply create a new view engine that had the
area view location formats that I cared about and inserted it first into
the view engines collection.

```csharp
public class SingleProjectAreasViewEngine : WebFormViewEngine {
    public SingleProjectAreasViewEngine() : this(
        new[] {
            "~/Areas/{2}/Views/{1}/{0}.aspx",
            "~/Areas/{2}/Views/{1}/{0}.ascx",
            "~/Areas/{2}/Shared/{0}.aspx",
            "~/Areas/{2}/Shared/{0}.ascx"
        },
        null,
        new[] {
            "~/Areas/{2}/Views/{1}/{0}.master",
            "~/Areas/{2}/Views/Shared/{0}.master",
        }
        ) {
    }

    public SingleProjectAreasViewEngine(
            IEnumerable<string> areaViewLocationFormats, 
            IEnumerable<string> areaPartialViewLocationFormats, 
            IEnumerable<string> areaMasterLocationFormats) : base() {
        this.AreaViewLocationFormats = areaViewLocationFormats.ToArray();
        this.AreaPartialViewLocationFormats = (areaPartialViewLocationFormats ?? 
            areaViewLocationFormats).ToArray();
        this.AreaMasterLocationFormats = areaMasterLocationFormats.ToArray();
    }
}
```

The constructor of this view engine simply specifies different format
strings. Here’s a case where I wish the Framework had a `String.Format`
method that efficiently worked with [named
formats](http://haacked.com/archive/2009/01/04/fun-with-named-formats-string-parsing-and-edge-cases.aspx "Named Formats").

This sample is made slightly more complicated by the fact that I have
another constructor that accepts all these formats. That makes it
possible to change the formats when registering the view engine if you
so choose.

In my web.config file, I then registered this view engine like so:

```csharp
protected void Application_Start() {
    RegisterRoutes(RouteTable.Routes);
    ViewEngines.Engines.Insert(0, new SingleProjectAreasViewEngine());
}
```

Note that I’m inserting it first so it takes precedence. I could have
cleared the collection and added this as the only one, but I wanted the
existing areas format for multi-project solutions to continue to work
just in case. It’s really your call.

Now I can register my area routes using a new MapAreaRoute extension
method.

```csharp
public static void RegisterRoutes(RouteCollection routes) {
    routes.IgnoreRoute("{resource}.axd/{*pathInfo}");

    routes.MapAreaRoute("Blogs", "blogs_area", 
        "blog/{controller}/{action}/{id}", 
        new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }, 
        new string[] { "SingleProjectAreas.Areas.Blogs.Controllers" });
    
    routes.MapAreaRoute("Forums", 
        "forums_area", 
        "forum/{controller}/{action}/{id}", 
        new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }, 
        new string[] { "SingleProjectAreas.Areas.Forums.Controllers" });
    
    routes.MapAreaRoute("Main", "default_route", 
        "{controller}/{action}/{id}", 
        new { controller = "Home", action = "Index", id = "" }, 
        new string[] { "SingleProjectAreas.Controllers" });
}
```

And I’m good to go. Notice that I no longer have a default route.
Instead, I mapped an area named “Main” to serve as the “main” project.
The Route URL pattern there is what you’d typically see in the default
template.

If you prefer this approach or would like to see both approaches
supported, let me know. We are looking at having the single project
approach supported out of the box as a possibility for Preview 2.
