If you read my blog in an aggregator, you probably haven't noticed the
little advertisements at the top of the page. These ads are served from
Google as part of their [AdSense](https://www.google.com/adsense/)
program and require a bit of javascript to display (hence they do not
show up in individual blog postings as I intended).

I put them there mainly as a whim since a) It's free and b) someday when
I'm destitute but read by millions, these ads will put food on the
table. Admittedly, I am not giving up my day job banking that "b" will
happen. However, my wife just informed me that she just noticed the ads
them and has been clicking on them all day. :D I let her know that
Google probably tracks cookies so that clicking on them repeatedly won't
make us rich, but I appreciate the intent. She's always looking out for
me. A truly lovely person.
