My friend Walter points out some [common sense
advice](http://spaces.msn.com/members/waltimate/Blog/cns!1pCvw_V_FwCgTXneX4GXlXLw!147.entry)
about how not to get fired for the content of your blog. Of course this
issue has been beaten to a pulp in the larger blogosphere, but one thing
he mentioned caught my attention.

You'd be surprised how easy it is for an employer to find your blog
without even meaning to. Unless you restrict your content to something
quite unrelated to any of your company's interest, your content is
almost certainly going to have posts that are related to your field.
That's when Google kicks in. The large majority of my referrals come
from Google searches. Often from people searching for information on a
particular technical problem I just happened to write about.

That's why the solution is to hide your identity and lie lie lie!
