UPDATE:*Well it turns out that half of
[WebHost4Life](http://webhost4life.com/)’s servers didn’t have enough
backup juice to stay up. Guess which half my blog was hosted on? Yep!
But it is back up now (which is obvious otherwise you wouldn’t be
reading this).*

Umm... sorry folks. I may have tripped on the power cord leading into
Los Angeles. I plugged it back in quickly. My power was only out for
around a minute, but others have been down much longer.

Yahoo news has the [more detailed
story](http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20050912/ap_on_re_us/la_power_outage).
