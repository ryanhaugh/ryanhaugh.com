This is an eye opening and interesting account of how Tom Oward was able
to data mine Amazon’s wish list database to get a profile of
“subversives” based on their requested reading list. Makes you think
twice before adding a book to your wishlist.

> Using a pair of 5-year-old computers, two home DSL connections, 42
> hours of computer time, and 5 man hours, I now had documents
> describing the reading preferences of 260,000 U.S. citizens.
>
> I downloaded all the files to an external 120 GB Firewire drive in UFS
> format. The raw data occupied little more than 5 GB. I initially
> wanted to move all the files into a single directory to facilitate
> searching, but as the directory contents exceeded 100,000 items, the
> speed became glacially slow, so I kept the data divided into chunks of
> 25,000 wishlists.
>
> Next comes the fun part – what books are most dangerous? So many to
> choose from. Here's a sample of the list I made. Feel free to make up
> your own list if you decide to try some data mining. Send it to the
> FBI. I'm sure they'll appreciate your help in fighting terrorism.
