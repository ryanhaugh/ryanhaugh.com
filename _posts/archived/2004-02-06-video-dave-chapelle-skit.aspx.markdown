[This is just too
funny!](http://www.comedycentral.com/mp/play.php?reposid=/multimedia/chappelle/showclips_s2/202_niggar.html)
It’s a skit about a white family with an unfortunate last name which
sounds just like a terrible racial epiteth, “Niggar”.

Dave Chappelle is a master at getting a laugh out of race issues. He’s
testing the boundaries of racial issues and finding laughs.

If you like this video, I suggest you check out [Chappelle's Show -
Season 1 on
DVD](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00018YCIM?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B00018YCIM).
His most memorable skit is the one in which he plays Clayton Bigsby, a
white supremacist who is both blind and black, only he doesn’t know he
is black because no one ever told him.
