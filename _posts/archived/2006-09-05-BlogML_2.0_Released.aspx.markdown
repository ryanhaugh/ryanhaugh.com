Seems like all sorts of open source projects have been releasing
lately.  [Darren Neimke](http://markitup.com/\) and [Keyvan
Nayyeri](http://nayyeri.net/) proudly announce the release of [BlogML
2.0](http://markitup.com/Posts/Post.aspx?postId=3d18797b-2c53-4aa3-88bc-ef1c97e84e5f)
on [CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/).  Here’s a [list of new
features](http://nayyeri.net/archive/2006/07/23/BlogML-new-features.aspx)
on Keyvan’s blog. With a bit of luck and lots of persistence, BlogML
will hopefully be a key component in breaking vendor lock-in when it
comes to blogging engine. 

For example, if you decide to try [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/)
as your blogging engine, and decide it’s not for you, I want you to have
**your** data in a form that is easy to import to other engines.  Why
should you have to write code to move from one platform to another?

I contributed a BlogML provider framework with the goal of making it
really easy to implement BlogML on other platforms.  For example, the
homegrown blog.  I don’t feel I fully accomplished the goal of making it
easy, but I think it’s a step in the right direction and I’m sure it’s
in good hands now.

Of course I am now pissed (for you British, that’s angry, not
drunk) that we have all this extra work to do for Subtext since we’re
still running BlogML 1.0 (legacy!), and 2.0 has already been out a few
hours!
