Let me know if you like these videos I’m posting or if you’re one video
away from cracking my skull with a wet noodle. Cause if you want to
crack my skull, you’re really going to have to wait in line.

Meanwhile, [watch as this skateboarder
skates](http://www.nike.com/illvill/video/balloonbowl.html) through a
pool full of blue balloons for a neat visual effect.

Update: As [Diego](http://diegop.blogspot.com/) points out, I always
forget to link. Damn it! Well I linked it now!
