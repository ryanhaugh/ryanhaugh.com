I don’t know about you, but when I find something wordy but really worth
reading on the web, I print it out. Sure, I could try reading it on my
tablet, but do you really want to deal with your tablet while reading in
the...er... “office” if you know what I mean? \*wink wink\* \*nudge
nudge\*

Unfortunately, the experience of printing many blog posts typically
includes an ink draining header graphic, an unecessary space wasting
sidebar or two, and the main fixed-width content being truncated off to
one side.

If you click through to an [individual blog
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/24/10336.aspx "Going Into Design Debt")
from my blog using a browser, you will notice that I now have a
**Print** button. Go ahead and click it. It should bring up the
following dialog.

![Print Dialog](http://haacked.com/images/PrintDialog.png)

Getting that dialog to display is quite simple. Here is the HTML.

```csharp
<a href="javascript:window.print();">Print</a>
```

However if you actually follow through and print a page, you can see
that the result only includes the contents of the post and does not
include my top navigation nor the sidebar. To test it out without
actually printing, try turning on print preview for your printer if your
printer driver software supports it.

The other thing you’ll notice is that the printed view displays the urls
for links alongside the link (if you are using a CSS2 conformant browser
such as Firefox). The image below is a screenshot from my poor quality
print preview.

Snippet](http://haacked.com/images/PrintPreviewSnippet.png)

So the obvious conceit here is that I expect to someday write something
worth printing. In the meanwhile, I have the print icon there to give
people the *impression* that my content is worth printing.

And setting this up is quite simple using media specific CSS. My blog
has a separate [css
stylesheet](http://haacked.com/skins/Haacked/print.css "Print Stylesheet")
for printing. The changes the stylesheet makes to the layout include
changing from a fixed-width layout to a 100% width layout as well as
setting the `display` of certain elements to none. Note that this print
specific stylesheet works whether a reader clicks on the print icon or
uses the browser’s print button.

My inspiration for setting this up was [this
article](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/goingtoprint "Going To Print")
in [A List Apart](http://www.alistapart.com/ "A List Apart Website") by
[Eric Meyer](http://www.meyerweb.com/eric/ "Eric Meyer"). His article
provides several tips for better web printing.

Setting This Up For Subtext
---------------------------

For those of you with a Subtext blog, how can you set this up for
yourself? Glad you asked.

One enhancement we made to the skinning engine over .TEXT is that we
added more options to the Skins.config file located in the Admin
directory.

A skin can now specify one or more script and css files. For script
files, you may specify the language, though javascript is the default.
For css files, you can specify the media type.

Here is a snippet from my Skins.config file. *Haacked* is my personally
customized skin not included with Subtext.

```csharp
<SkinTemplate SkinID="Haacked" Skin="Haacked">
    <Scripts>
        <Script Src="scripts/ExternalLinks.js" />
        <Script Src="scripts/LiveCommentPreview.js" />
        <Script Src="scripts/tableEffects.js" />
    </Scripts>
    <Styles>
        <Style href="IEPatches.css" />
        <Style href="print.css" media="print" />
    </Styles>
</SkinTemplate>
```

As with .TEXT, the skinning engine just assumes that there is a
`style.css` in the root of your skin’s directory, so it does not need to
be specified here. However, now you may simply add additional css files
for your skin to reference. In the snippet above, you can see I have a
separate file for IE CSS hacks as well as a separate css file for
printing.

The declaration for `print.css` includes a value of “print” for media.
Other allowed values include, [all, aural, braille, embossed, handheld,
print, projection, screen, tty,
tv](http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_mediatypes.asp "CSS Media Types"),
though for everyday use, most developers will stick to print and screen.

After setting a reference to your print.css file in the Skins.config
file, simply add a print.css file to your skins root and you are on your
way to better printing.
