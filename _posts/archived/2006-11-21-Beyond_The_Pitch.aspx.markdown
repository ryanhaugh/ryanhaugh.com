Here in the good ole U.S. and A, soccer doesn’t yet have the huge
following or celebrity status that it does overseas. On one level, this
is a good thing, as it means getting tickets for a game the day before
is never too big a challenge.  On the downside, the quality of the game
is often lacking especially when compared to watching a team like [FC
Barcelona](http://www.fcbarcelona.com/eng/home-page/home/home.shtml "FC Barcelona").

However that may change in the future as it is one of the largest, if
not largest, sports among kids today.  So while soccer players (excuse
me, footballers) in the US don’t have the celebrity status of a
Basketball player, there are plenty of fans interested in knowing what
it’s like to be a professional player.

My buddies Donny and Cory (past soccer teammates) figured the same thing
so they came up with an idea for a show that would highlight pro soccer
players in the U.S. (and probably beyond at some point).  The show would
basically be a sort of *Day In The Life* type of format.  I’ve been
hearing Donny go on and on about this show for a while now, and it’s
great to see it really happening.

Check out this [promo
video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eMyhjCI3lX8 "Beyond The Pitch")
for the show called *Beyond the Pitch*.  My only contribution to this
was to say I thought it was a brilliant idea. Something I’d definitely
watch.  This video is a short cut from a pilot they filmed with Kevin
Hartman. It’s used to sell the show and may never actually air as an
episode.  Keep that in mind, as the final product will probably be even
more polished.
