Prolific blogger Mr. [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/ "Coding Horror"), author of the
CodingHorror blog, paid us a surprise visit last night. He is in town
for a couple of days to do something or other unimportant. He tried to
explain something about presenting Team System to important people but
all I heard was “blah blah TS blah blah”.

After a fine dinner at the new Ford Filling Station (owned by Harrison
Ford’s son) we gathered around the screen and had a chat with the
not-so-prolific blogger lately, [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "JonGalloway.ToString()").

So that there is Jeff on the left getting cozy with Jon on the right,
who couldn’t make it in person but would like to thank the academy via
live video feed courtesy of Skype™.

Jeff is one of the few people who regularly reads my blog through one of
these antiquated mediums called a browser. Which is actually great since
he gets to experience the very cool drop-shadow effects I apply to my
photos. Go CSS!

After a bit of plotting to overtake the planet and typical jokes at each
others expense, we all went our merry ways. Except for me, I live here.
