I was reading [Jeff Atwood’s](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror")
latest post, [Programming: Love it or Leave
it](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/001202.html "Programming: Love it or Leave it")
when I came across this part, emphasis mine.

Unlike Jeff, I ***will*** go that far. I love to code, and I do it for
free all the time.

I don’t think Joel meant to imply that programmers would continue to
write code for their current employers for free in lieu of any pay. What
I think he meant was that programmers who love to code will code for fun
as well as profit. They’ll write code outside of their paying jobs.

For example, I took the entire week off last week and spent lots of time
with my family, which was wonderful (*cue gratuitous picture of kid*)! I
trained my son in Ninja acrobatics.

I got my brother completely hooked on [Desktop Tower
Defense](http://www.kongregate.com/games/preecep/desktop-tower-defense-1-5 "Desktop Tower Defense").

And tried to figure out what sort of mischief my son was involved in, as
that face is as guilty as sin.

However, along with all that family fun, I spent nearly every minute of
downtime hacking on
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website"). I went
on a huge refactoring binge cleaning up stale code, separating concerns
left and right, and replacing the old method of matching requests with
ASP.NET Routing.

And it was huge fun!

And I’m not alone. I noticed several streams on Twitter of folks having
fun writing code, such as [Glenn
Block](http://blogs.msdn.com/gblock/ "Glenn Block") sharing his
[learning in the open
experiences](http://twitter.com/gblock/status/1083305303 "Glenn on Twitter"),
among others.

Developers I’ve worked with who really love to code, tend to do it for
fun, as well as for work. Personally, I don’t think it’s unhealthy as
long as it’s not the *only* thing you do for fun. And I’m not suggesting
that if you don’t do it for fun, you don’t love to code. Some people
work so much, they don’t have time to do it for fun, but would code for
fun if they had copious free time.

As for me, I’ll say it again, I **\<3**to code.
