I'll be honest. Basketball is my second favorite sport, but by a slim
margin to that sport of sports, soccer. Being 5' 9", soccer comes more
naturally to me. I only made it to the JV level in high school
basketball, but played at the Varsity and Division 3 college level in
soccer, which is not saying much.

I've started playing basketball at the Y in the morning before work. It
was a slow start, but today I had one of those games that reminds me why
I love this game. I felt like I was firing on all cylinders.

When you take a moment to think about it, the computational output of
your brain while playing sports is amazing. It will take a loooong time
before a robot comes anywhere close. Think of all the unconscious
calculations you make in a split-second play.

> There! The gap is just wide enough. Avoid the hands reaching in and

This entire thought process occurrs in about a second. That's the rush
of basketball my friend.
