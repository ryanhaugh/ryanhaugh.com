If you downloaded [Subtext last
night](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/05/11/subtext-1.9.5-release.aspx "Subtext Last Night")
and try to edit keywords in the admin section, you might run into a
syntax error. I fixed the download so if the file you download is named

*SubText-1.9.5-INSTALL.zip*

(notice the all caps "INSTALL") you have nothing to worry about.

If you downloaded

*SubText-1.9.5-Install.zip*

Then you might want toÂ replace the *EditKeywords.aspx* file in the
*Admin* folder [with this
one](http://haacked.com/code/EditKeyWords.zip "EditKeyWords.aspx file").

My apologies. I thought I had tested every page in the admin before
releasing, but it was late and I must have missed this one. I never use
that page day to day so my dogfooding attempts surely missed it.
