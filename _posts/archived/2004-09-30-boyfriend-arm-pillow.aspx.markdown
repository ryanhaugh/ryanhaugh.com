You gotta love the Japanese for making such interesting products. The
company that makes this disembodied arm pillow has sold 1000 units since
last December. It's actually genius if you think about it.

 Aiko's pillow attempts to cop a feel

My arm always falls painfully asleep when my wife lays on it like in the
picture. I could get one of these and reclaim my arm. Just as long as
the pillow doesn't try to make any untoward moves.
