![Crook](/images/crook.jpg) Apparently someone went on an online
shopping spree with our credit card number. Fortunately the Bank of
America protection kicked in before they could do too much damage and we
will not be charged for the fraudelent activity. It's mind bogglingly
easy for someone to fraudelently use your credit card. Think about that
the next time you hand your credit card to the waiter at the local dive.

In any case, there are a couple of options at your disposal. My friend
Walter writes about placing a fraud alert on your credit file as well as
the California Credit Freeze option. I highly recommend [taking a look

whether or not you've been a victim of credit card fraud.
