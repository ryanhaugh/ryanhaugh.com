![Ali G](/images/AliG.jpg)Apparently, Andy Rooney has no [patience
for](http://www.nypost.com/entertainment/27433.htm) faux british
rappers. If you've never seen the Ali G show, it's worth a watch. One of
the funniest episodes I've seen was when he was visiting a K-9 police
unit and asked the trainer in his "urban" style,\
"Has yous eva thinks to use dogs instead of canines?"\
To which the officer replied, canines are dogs. Ali G then asks, \
"Ok, has you's eva thinks to use dolphins? I Heahs they's smarter than
dogs."

Ali G once asked a former CIA director, \
"Is yous worried dat da terrorists goin ta attack the White House with
trains?"\
The former director responded, \
"No, there are no tracks leading to the White House."\
\
"Perhaps theys building dem at night."

Boo-Ya Kashaa! Respek!

Thanks to DK for the scoop.
