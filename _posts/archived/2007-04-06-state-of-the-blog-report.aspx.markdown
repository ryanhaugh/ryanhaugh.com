Technorati recently released their latest [State of The
Blogosphere](http://technorati.com/weblog/2007/04/328.html "State of the Blogosphere")
report (renamed to something about the *Live Web* to avoid confusion
with the *Dead Web*) chock full of statistics and pretty graphs.

This would be interesting, if I were interested in anything other than
myself. No, I don’t care about how other blogs are doing. I only care
about Me Me ME!

**How is *MY* Blog doing?**

To find out I could check on some external sources. For example,
Alexa.com shows that my site has experienced steady growth in the [past
three
years](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=haacked.com&site1=&site2=&site3=&site4=&y=r&z=1&h=300&w=540&range=3y&size=Medium&url=haacked.com "Chart of reach for the past 3 years of Haacked.com")
(click on the chart to see the actual report page).

[![Alexa Graph of Haacked.com over 3
years](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/StateOfMyBlogReport_DC08/haackedcomalexa3year5.png)](http://www.alexa.com/data/details/traffic_details?site0=haacked.com&site1=&site2=&site3=&site4=&y=r&z=1&h=300&w=540&range=3y&size=Medium&url=haacked.com "Haacked.com traffic over 3 years")

But lest I let that go to my head, let’s compare my site’s reach with my
friend [Jeff’s](http://codinghorror.com/ "Jeff Atwood’s Blog") using
Alexa’s comparison tool.

Hmmm, it may be high time I contrive my own crowd pleaser [FizzBuzz
post](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000781.html "FizzBuzz").

Moving on, let’s see what [Technorati has to
say](http://technorati.com/search/haacked.com "Technorati Search for Haacked.com").

[![Haacked.com on Technorati - Rank 6358 (1276 links from 473
blogs)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/StateOfMyBlogReport_DC08/technoratihaacked5.png)](http://technorati.com/search/haacked.com)

Wow. 6358 is a big number! That’s good right? Oh, maybe not. But we can
see that 473 blogs have provided 1276 links to my blog. I should hit
these suckers up for a loan!

Let’s swing over to see what Feedburner says:

![Subscribers: 3,339. Site Visitors:
1,334](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/StateOfMyBlogReport_DC08/haackedfeedburner4.png)

It’d be nice to have just one score to look at. Let’s swing over to the
[Website Grader](http://www.websitegrader.com/ "Website Grader").

[![Website Grade: 97/100 Page Rank:
6](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/StateOfMyBlogReport_DC08/websitegrade10.png)](http://www.websitegrader.com/DesktopModules/Ingeni-WebsiteGrader/Reports/haacked.com.html)

I could have saved some time by just going here first. *Hey Ma! I got an
A! Can I leave the cage?*

### Looking Inward

Well, if there’s one thing I learned about happiness it’s to look for it
inward, rather than relying on external validation. That way, you don’t
have to let reality intrude on your carefully crafted world view. So
let’s look at some internal statistics.

-   Posts - 1322
-   Comments - 2510
-   Spam Comments - 9818 (which is low because I periodically clean out
    the table)

Hmmm... I wonder what are my five most popular posts based on [Ayende’s
formula](http://ayende.com/Blog/archive/2007/03/09/Calculating-most-popular-posts-with-SubText.aspx "Calculating Most Popular Posts").

Title | Web Views
------|----------
[Video: The Dave Chappelle Show](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/02/06/video-dave-chapelle-skit.aspx "Video Chappelle Family") | 169,398
[PHOTO: When Nerds Protest The RNC](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/08/30/when-nerds-protest.aspx "Nerds Protest") | 81,353
[Year of the Golden Pig](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/01/03/Year_of_the_Golden_Pig.aspx "Golden Pig") | 60,316
[Response.Redirect vs Server.Transfer](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/06/responseredirectverseservertransfer.aspx "Redirect vs Transfer") | 54,076
[Using a Regular Expression to Match HTML](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/25/UsingRegularExpressionsToMatchHTML.aspx "Redirect vs Transfer") | 37,807

I won’t lie. It depresses me a bit to learn that my three most popular
posts have nothing to do with technology. Not only that, the most
popular post by a longshot is a skit about a family with an unfortunate
last name. It’s a mispelling of a horrible racial epithet, which happens
to bring alot of bad spelling racists in search of god knows what.

### What the Numbers Don’t Say

Well all these numbers are fine and good, but they can't measure the
enjoyment I get out of blogging. Nor can they measure the satisfaction
that some readers (any reader?) gets from reading my posts. At least not
until someone builds Satisfactorati or Satisfactorl.icio.us.

The numbers may not support my complete self-centered ego-centric view,
but when has vanity and a self-inflated ego ever been subdued with so
called “facts”?

**So what is the state of your blog?**

Vanity](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/10/08/BloggingIsPureVanity.aspx "Blogging Is Pure Vanity")
