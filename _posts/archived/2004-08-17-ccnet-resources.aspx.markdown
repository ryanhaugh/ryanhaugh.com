Since I’m just getting started with Cruise Control, I thought I’d look
around the web and blogosphere and put together some resources on
configuring CruiseControl.NET.

-   [Cruise Control
    Hierarchy](http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Craig.CruiseControlDirectoryHierarchy)
    - Craig Andera describes how he likes to set up directories in
    CruiseControl.NET
-   [Setting Up Continuous
    Integration](http://blogs.geekdojo.net/joel/archive/2004/08/15/2827.aspx)
    - Joel outlines the steps he takes to set up CruiseControl.NET.
-   [Lessons Learned From Setting Up
    CruiseControl.NET](http://weblogs.ilg.com/ksyverstad/articles/155.aspx)
    - Kris Syverstad provides some lessons learned while trying to
    configure CruiseControl .NET and offers some tips.
-   [CruiseControl.NET from
    Scratch](http://joefield.mysite4now.com/blog/articles/146.aspx) -
    Joe Field writes a guide to getting started with CruiseControl.NET.

And there’s also the CruiseControl.NET [site
itself](http://ccnet.thoughtworks.com/) and the [community
site](http://confluence.public.thoughtworks.org/display/CCNETCOMM/Home).

After reading through many of these resources, I have a question about
directory structures. You see, I try to be an obedient Microsoft
developer (will it pay off?) and set up my directories as outlined in
the Microsoft Patterns & Practices article [Team Development with Visual
Studio .NET and Visual
SourceSafe](http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dnbda/html/tdlg_rm.asp).

The article proposes that you group code into "Systems" which may
contain one or more VS.NET Solutions. A Solution of course may contain
one or more Projects. Below is figure 3.5 from the article illustrating
the directory structure.

In general, projects and solutions won’t be shared across systems, i.e.
a solution in one system won’t reference a project in another. However I
do have one exception in that I have a code library system with projects
that other solutions may reference. For example:

    Projects
        CodeLibrarySystem
            CodeLibrarySolution
                Project1
                Project2

        SomeOtherSystem
            SomeSolution
                Project1
                Project3

So, in my case, should I map a CruiseControl.NET project to a System or
a Solution? Any recommendations?
