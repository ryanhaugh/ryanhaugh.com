Like a lovesick puppy, my good friend [Rob
Conery](http://blog.wekeroad.com/ "Rob Conery") is [following me to
Microsoft](http://blog.wekeroad.com/2007/10/26/microsoft-subsonic-and-me/ "Rob Conery, Subsonic, and Microsoft").

I’m excited (not yet *super* excited) that Rob is going to be joining us
working on
[Subsonic](http://www.subsonicproject.com/ "Subsonic Project Site") as
the sugar on top of the work we’re doing with the MVC framework. Good
times! We’re definitely going to have to celebrate in Vegas at the
[DotNetNuke
conference](http://www.dotnetnuke.com/Community/Blogs/tabid/825/EntryID/1412/Default.aspx "DotNetNuke Conference")
and
[DevConnections](http://www.devconnections.com/ "DevConnections conference")
(*you all will be there, won’t you?*)

This is perhaps another item to add to [the list I
made](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/07/26/microsoft-and-open-source.aspx "Microsoft and Open Source")
of signs of progress in regards to how Microsoft is approaching Open
Source.

Rob, be sure to read [Dan Fernandez’s
post](http://blogs.msdn.com/danielfe/archive/2007/10/26/the-stages-for-new-employees-at-microsoft.aspx "Stages for new employees")
on the stages of new employees at Microsoft employee.

I really think our first order of business is to build a sample MVC
application using
[LOLCode.NET](http://blog.notdot.net/archives/32-LOLCode.net-Now-your-LOLCats-can-use-the-CLR!.html "LOLCode compiler for .NET").
Until your framework supports LOLCode, nobody takes you seriously.
