Many developers, especially those fresh out of college (though older
developers are just as prone), fall into the trap of believing in an
absolute concept of “the perfect design”. I hate to break such youthful
idealism, but there’s just no such thing.

Design is always a series of trade-offs in an arduous struggle to
implement the best solution given a set of competing constraints. And
there are always constraints.

Not too long ago, I had an interesting discussion with a young developer
who was unhappy with the design of a project he was working on. This
project had a very aggressive schedule, and he complained about the poor
design of the system.

“So why do you think it is poorly designed, the system appears to have
met the requirements, especially given the short time constraint”, I
asked him. He explained how he would have preferred a system that
abstracted the data access via some form of Object Relational Mapping,
rather than simply pulling data from the table and slapping that data on
a page via data binding. He also would have liked to clean up the object
model. It was’t in his mind, “good design”.

I pointed out that it also wouldn’t have been good design to spend time
choosing and getting up to speed with an ORM tool, only to deliver the
software late (which was not an option). Sure, the code would have been
well factored, but we had a hard deadline, and missing it would have
been a huge burden on the company.

I suggested to him that **constraints are necessary** for a software
project. I told him,

> If a project doesn’t have a time constraint, it will never get
> finished.

That lit a lightbulb for this developer.

> That explains why I never finish my personal projects.

Absolutely! With no time constraint, this developer would spend more
time after more time attempting to hit that elusive goal of the “perfect
design”. But that goal will never be reached **because perfect design is
asymptotic**. You can get infinitely close, but you can never reach it.

In the end, I told the developer that he’ll have the opportunity to
refactor the code into a better design in the second phase of the
project, as the time constraint is no longer so aggressive. I also
suggested he skim *[Small Things Considered: Why There Is No Perfect
Design](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400032938?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400032938)*
by Henry Petroski. The book makes its main point in the first chapter,
that design is about compromise and managing trade-offs to meet
constraints. The rest of the book is a tour of various design decisions
in history that illustrate this central theme.
