Yes, yet again I have purchased tickets to [Burning
Man](http://www.burningman.com/ "BurningMan Homepage") scheduled for
August 28 through September 4, 2006. And you better believe I am
bringing the *prep* back!

Playa](http://static.flickr.com/50/128781819_a6ffdef0c2.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/128781819/ "Photo Sharing")

I must be an addict for pain, discomfort, and Playa dust to return a
third time. But I had such a great time [last
time](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/09/10/PhotosFromBurningMan.aspx "Last Time At BurningMan"),
and the [time
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/07/18/BurningManPhotopedia.aspx "Burning Man 2005"),
that I just couldnâ€™t hold back. And this time, I am dragging my [buddy
(and business partner) Micah](http://micahdylan.com/ "Micah Dylan")
along. Still working on getting Kyle to come again.
