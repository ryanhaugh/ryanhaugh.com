A little while back [Scott
Watermasysk](http://scottwater.com/blog/ "Scott Watermasysk's blog"),
preparing for the arrival of his first child, [asked for
advice](http://scottwater.com/blog/archive/best-compact-digital-camera/ "Best Compact Digital Camera")
on finding a really good compact digital camera.

Funny how having a kid turns a geek’s thought to getting that perfect
camera to capture the moment. It was exactly what I did (but *after*
Cody was born) when my wife and I purchased a [Canon PowerShot SD850 IS
Digital
ELPH](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000Q30420?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=B000Q30420 "Ultracompact camera on Amazon.com")
for Father’s day.

that’s a bit of a mouthful for a camera name, but the two letters that
were important to me were *I and S*which stands for *Image
Stabilization*.

The SD850 combines that with a sensitivity range up to ISO 1600 for
better photos in low light, a real problem area with my previous camera
due to its suckiness and my incredibly shaky hands. Seriously, you don’t
want me doing surgery on you.

[![833729001\_7c7808a0c5](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/DontchaWishYourCameraWasHotLikeMine_102C8/833729001_7c7808a0c5_thumb.jpg)](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/DontchaWishYourCameraWasHotLikeMine_102C8/833729001_7c7808a0c5.jpg)The
other key features I was looking for was small in size (3.6 x 1 x 2.2
inches) so I can get all secret agent with it and face detection, for
better portraiture.

So far, I’m very happy with it. The pictures have been very sharp with
good color. I should have known to stick with the ELPH series as my
first ELPH took great photos despite only being 2.2 megapixel.

This one boasts 8 megapixels (really more than I need) and 4x optical
zoom. That there on the right is a picture of my son in a Brasil jersey
given to him by my wife’s Brazillian coworker. Doesn’t he look sharp?

Now you know why Brazil just beat the heavily favored Argentina in the
Copa America. Cody Power!
