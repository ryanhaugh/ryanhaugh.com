The [June
issue](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-06/content "June PragPub HTML")
(also in
[pdf](http://pragprog.com/magazines/download/12.pdf "June Issue of PragPub"))
of the online PragPub magazine, published by the [Pragmatic
Bookshelf](http://pragprog.com/ "PragProg") has two articles on ASP.NET
MVC.

The first is called [Agile
Microsoft](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-06/agile-microsoft "Agile Microsoft")
and is an introduction to ASP.NET MVC geared towards those who’ve never
seen it. It’s nice seeing ASP.NET MVC featured in this magazine which in
its own words tends to cater to a non-Microsoft crowd.

> To some developers, Microsoft’s technologies are a given, the river
> they swim in. To others, *not* using Microsoft’s tools is the default.
> *PragPub* being an open source- and Agile-friendly kind of magazine,
> we tend to connect with the latter group.

> So when we get an article titled “Agile Microsoft,” we are naturally
> intrigued. And we think you’ll also be intrigued by Jonathan
> McCracken’s introduction toASP.NET MVC, a framework that some have
> called **“Rails for .NET.”**

The second article is an [interview with
me](http://pragprog.com/magazines/2010-06/why-aspnet-mvc "Why ASP.NET MVC?")
entitled “Why ASP.NET MVC?” where I ramble on about how if wandering the
halls of Microsoft doesn’t get you tossed out by security, it might land
you a great job, as well as ASP.NET MVC, TDD, and Open Source Software.

Something I found interesting was that the person who interviewed me was
[Michael Swaine](ttp://www.swaine.com/ "Michael Swaine's Website") who
co-wrote the book, [Fire in the
Valley](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0071358927?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0071358927 "Fire in the Valley at Amazon"),
that the movie [Pirates of Silicon
Valley](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0009NSCS0?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0009NSCS0 "Pirates of Silicon Valley")
(no Jonny Depp in this one) was based on. The movie (and book) covers
the rise of the computer industry and Steve Jobs, Bill Gates, among
others.
