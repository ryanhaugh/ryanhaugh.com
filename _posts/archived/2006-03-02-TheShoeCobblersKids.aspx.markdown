![Shoeless](http://haacked.com/images/shoeless.jpg) An old saying I’ve
been using a lot lately is the old saw “A shoe cobbler’s kids go
shoeless”. Basically, it points out how difficult it is to keep one’s
own affairs in order when it is one’s job to do so for others. As an
example, my company is in the business of building fantastic technology
solutions, but [our own website](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT Website")
is rather neglected. This is something we see as a real problem and will
address soon.

In truth, falling into this trap is understandable, but a bad idea. What
better advertising for the shoe cobbler than to have his kids in
fantastic shoes? But the fact that there is even a saying about this
reflects just how common this is. When starting a business, your first
priority in the early stages is to get the cash flow going and make sure
your customers are happy and well fed. Only then can you take the
necessary chunk time to really focus ony our own needs. But until then,
you shouldn’t totally neglect yourself. You wouldn’t want to hurt future
growth for near term gains.

The point of all this is that I have updated my blog to the latest
release. I was running an older internal build of Subtext for a while
which had a couple bugs that would make themselves evident. The last
thing I wanted is for someone to see the announcement on my site, notice
the bug, and make a judgement based on that.

The noticeable difference is that there is now a comment preview feature
as well as a recent comments display on the right. I’ll probably be
tweaking my skin in the near future adding a few fun goodies.
