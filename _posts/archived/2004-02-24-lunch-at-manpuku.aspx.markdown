Just had lunch with Erik and Ben at Manpuku. If you’ve never been,
Manpuku is on Sawtelle just north of Olympic in the strip mall where
Hurry Curry is. If none of that made sense to you, then you probably
don’t live in L.A. ;)

In any case, they had the bento boxes and I had an Ishiyaki Bibimpap.
Rice with vegetables and ground beef, served in a steaming hot clay bowl
with a red hot paste mixed in. Too good.

In any case, sounds like Ben and Erik are doing well at my former
establishment of employment. Erik and his wife are expecting in two
months. Not much has changed, we spent five minutes catching up on
personal lives, and 55 minutes talking about Microsoft Reporting
Services and the various code we're all writing.
