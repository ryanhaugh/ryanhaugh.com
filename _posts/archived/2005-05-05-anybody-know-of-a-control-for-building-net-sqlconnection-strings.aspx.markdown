I'm looking for a Windows Forms control or dialog used to both parse and
build connection strings by walking the user though selecting a server,
database, etc...

If you know of such a control, please provide a comment. I've been able
to build OLEDB connection strings using the Microsoft OLE DB type
library, but it only produces OLEDB connection string. I want a dialog
or control that can walk a user into building a valid connection string
like:

> Server=localhost;Database=SubtextData;Trusted\_Connection=True

Thanks!
