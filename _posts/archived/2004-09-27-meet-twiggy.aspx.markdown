Twiggy is our new Italian Greyhound (not to be confused with a normal
greyhound). She's around two years old (we don't know for sure) and she
has a major case of Attention Deficit Disorder. Fully grown, she's only
ten pounds.

![Twiggy](/images/Twiggy.jpg) Hello, my name is Twiggy

We're working around the clock to get her house trained. Apparently her
previous owners didn't know how to take good care of her. She pretty
much won't do her thing outdoors, prefering the comfort of the indoor
accomodations. Also, if you look closely, you'll see she has stitches
above one eye. She used to live in a yard with a terrier and a
Rotweiler. Rotweilers are playful.

I have a major overbite so my tongue hangs out a bit.

Despite the accident with the Rotweiler, she still is very friendly to
other dogs and people, and has an insatiable curiosity.

We have an excercise pen for her as IGs are not supposed to be left
unattended in the house. They are superb climbers, and even better at
falling and breaking a leg. When I take her for a walk, she tries to get
into everything.

I like to sniff everything.

Well thanks for saying hi to the newest member of our family.
