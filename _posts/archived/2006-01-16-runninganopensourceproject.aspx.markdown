I just finished reading the book "[Producing Open Source Software - How
to Run a Successful Free Software
Project](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596007590?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&link_code=as3&camp=211189&creative=373489&creativeASIN=0596007590 "Producing Open Source Software on Amazon")"
by Karl Fogel ([pdf
available](http://producingoss.com/producingoss.pdf)).
[CollabNet](http://www.collab.net/) has employed Karl Fogel for the past
five years to work on Subversion. Prior to that he has been involved
with GNU Emacs and CVS development.

If you fall in one of the following categories, I highly recommend
taking the time to read this book. Especially if you fall in one of the
first two.

-   Planning to start an open source project
-   Currently running an open source project
-   Involved with an open source project
-   Managing a team of distributed developers

Much of this book is really a primer on how to work with and manage
people. After all, open source development is really built on
relationships more than even technical know-how. Manage the
relationships well, and people will happily contribute. Do a poor job,
and you may find interest lacking (though interest may lack for many
other reasons as well).

But Fogel also delves into how to structure a project and administer the
day-to-day activities that are required to run a project smoothly. Some
of the topics he covers include:

-   How to choose a license
-   Who to give commit access to
-   Writing Developer Guidelines
-   Hosting and choosing version control
-   Managing communications
-   Assigning roles
-   Voting

And the list goes on.

It is my hope to start applying some of the principles he writes to open
source projects I am involved with such as
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website"). Though
Fogel’s experience and advice seems targetted to very large open source
projects, I think much of it is useful for small projects as well.
Besides, if you don’t prepare for growth, you will never see growth. And
if you do grow big suddenly, it is better to be prepared than caught
off-guard. But having said that, it is also important to adjust the
level of formality in processes and structure to agree with the size of
the project. So I won’t let myself get carried away.

Instead, I hope to start a short blog series to summarize and perhaps
expand on certain principles gleaned from the book.
