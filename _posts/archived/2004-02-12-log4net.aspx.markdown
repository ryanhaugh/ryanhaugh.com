I just finished reading the [Log4Net
Introduction](http://log4net.sourceforge.net/release/1.2.0.30507/doc/manual/introduction.html "Log4Net Introduction")
and
[FAQ](http://log4net.sourceforge.net/release/1.2.0.30507/doc/manual/faq.html "FAQ")
and realize I've been missing out all these years. I won't retrofit my
current App (just yet), but I definitely need to give Log4Net a try with
future projects.

In particular, I like the hierarchical logging that it enables, both
with log levels and with the equivalent of logging namespaces. For
exampl, you can create a log named "Security" and another log with
"Security.Access". If you set a log level on Security, the
Security.Access will inherit that log level (unless you also specify a
log level for it). Very cool.
