![Soccer Ball](/images/soccerball.jpg) I once scored even faster than
this... oh wait, we're talking soccer here.

This must have been a nice shot off the kickoff. In college we once had
a friendly scrimmage with the women's team. To help even things up, our
coach (who played professionally) played on the women's side. In order
to humble our loudmouth goalie during after we had scored, took a tap
off the kickoff and sailed it into the net over his head. I didn't time
it, but I imagine it was close to 2.5 seconds.

> England Football Association on Tuesday.
