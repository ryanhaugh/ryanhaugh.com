We fly off tomorrow to Seattle and don't let me catch you even thinking
about trying to snake my stuff. I live in a very bad neighborhood, you
wouldn't want to be there after dark or in the nude. We have vicious
blind dogs in the yard that have been raised on human meat and will bite
anything that breathes or walks funny. And robots in the house with
lasers and duct tape and ... and Barry Manilow CDs!

And...um.. we have cameras all over the place, and a direct upload to
America's Funniest Home Videos so everyone can laugh at you when you're
attacked by blind dogs, including the girl in HR who never looks in your
direction you pathetic slob.

Besides, my stereo is out-dated and sounds crappy. But I hear the
neighbors just bought a huge flat panel HDTV with a Bang & Olufsen
stereo. You should steal their shit instead.
