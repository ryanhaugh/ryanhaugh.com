![Poker Chips](/images/chips.jpg)Rory at
[Neopoleon.com](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/4954.aspx) has an
interesting proposition for would-be Computer Science mentors.
Basically, he’s willing to pay for one-on-one tutoring in CS concepts
over the web.

It’s an interesting idea if it works. In fact, it inspires me because I
could use some tutoring myself, though my goal is not as lofty. Are
there any experts out there at Poker, specifically Texas Hold'em?

I lost a wee bit o’ money this weekend and could use a refresher on how
to play well. ;)
