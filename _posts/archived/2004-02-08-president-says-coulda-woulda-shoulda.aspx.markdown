I thought this was a joke until I realized that it was on Yahoo news.
Bush and Cheney say we attacked Iraq because Saddam COULD HAVE made
weapons of mass destruction. "Could have". Gee, well North Korea "could
have" made WMDs. Should we attack them? How about India who DO have.
Heck, with a bit of time, I think I have enough intelligence and skill
to make a WMD. Should I expect an airstrike on my apartment sometime
soon? I hope not, my wife would not be pleased.

This turnaround is particularly amusing because didn't Bush and his
cronies attempt to educate the country about the concept of "Imminent
Threat". Saddam posed an "Imminent Threat". I don't know about you, but
"Could Have" does not seem so immiment to me. It's like locking me up
because I could have made a baseball bat and beat you down. Certainly I
could, but it will take me time to find the right piece of oak.
