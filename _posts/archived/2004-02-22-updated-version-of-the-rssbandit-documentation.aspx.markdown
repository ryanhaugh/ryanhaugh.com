UPDATE: Whoops! I should have read the SLA for my free hosting provider
more carefully. There’s a size limit to the files I may post on my ftp
server. I will work to rectify this situation by finding a new FTP site.
In the meantime, email me and I will send you the documents referenced
below.

This is a work in progress. Pick up the Word doc
[here](http://haacked.com/docs/GettingStartedWithRssBandit.zip "Getting Started With RSSBandit").
Please make updates and changes with change tracking on and I’ll be sure
to incorporate them into the master document.

Also, just for kicks, I generated MSDN style documentation of the
RssBandit class library using NDoc. You can pick that up
[here](http://haacked.europe.webmatrixhosting.net/docs/RssBandit%20Class%20Library%20Documentation.zip)

If the files are unavailable, let me know. Sometimes files get deleted
if I go over my quota.
