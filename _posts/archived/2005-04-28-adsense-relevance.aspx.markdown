![Orange Chicken](/images/OrangeChicken.jpg) In [my
comments](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/29/2874.aspx#2876),
[Barry](http://idunno.org/)winces at the relevance of some Ad Sense ads
he sees.

For the most part, I've been quite impressed by AdSense relevancy. For a
while now, I've had nice colorful Family Guy ads on my [home
page](http://haacked.com/). When I wrote about my [Orange Chicken
incident](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/27/2038.aspx), a commenter
pointed out that I hilariously had ads for Orange Chicken on my blog.

But ad-sense can backfire as well. I had one post where I was critical
of the Republican party and I noticed that Google was showing ads
seeking fund raisers for the GOP. I laughed out loud and figured, hey,
that's a good way to keep my blog balanced. Everytime I criticize the
Republican party, my ads will balance that by advertising for them. I'll
criticize the ineffective Democrats as well so that this post gets ads
for Libertarians or the Green party.

UPDATE: Looks like [Rory's
noticing](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/13943.aspx) how eerily
relevant AdSense can be.
