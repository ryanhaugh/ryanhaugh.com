[FogCreek](http://fogcreek.com/) commissioned [a
documentary](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2005/11/07.html) about
their summer intern project named
[Aardvark](http://www.projectaardvark.com/archive/june.html) which ended
up releasing [Copilot](https://www.copilot.com/), a product to help your
mom with her computer woes.

I think it’s intriguing in the voyeuristic sense in that I like the idea
of taking a look inside how other companies manage their software
projects. But at \$19.95 a pop, It’ll have to be picked up by NetFlix
for me to watch it, which doesn’t seem likely.

It makes me wonder if I should buy it as a show of solidarity to say
there is a demand for documentaries and movies that provide a realistic
view of software development.

Perhaps not surprisingly, software development doesn’t get much respect
nor recognition in Hollywood. The depictions out there that do exist are
typically ludicrous ([Swordfish](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0244244/)
anyone?). Neither do television shows address the subject.

There are plenty of shows about lawyers and doctors, but what about the
software developers? You can’t sit there and tell me that open heart
surgery is more exciting than completing a refactoring on a method and
getting green bars on your unit tests. Ok, maybe it is a tad bit more
exciting as a life is on the line as opposed to someone’s butt, but the
interesting part of such shows such as [Grey’s
Anatomy](http://abc.go.com/primetime/greysanatomy/) and Law and Order
are the backstories, not the medicine nor law being practiced.

Comics like Dilbert give a hint at the comedy potential for a show
depicting software developers. So c’mon Hollywood, copy this idea (since
that is the modus operandi). I saved you the trouble from having to
think of it yourself.
