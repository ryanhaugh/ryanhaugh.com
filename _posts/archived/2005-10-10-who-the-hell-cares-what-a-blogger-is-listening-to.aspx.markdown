Every now and then on various blogs (including mine), you’ll notice a
little snippet at the bottom of a post that looks something like...

[Listening to: Never Forget - Paul Van Dyk - Reflections (5:26)]

This is usually inserted by a plug-in to some media player (in my case
iTunes) that allows the blogger to easily insert information about what
is currently playing.

So in the comments of [my last
post](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/10/10/10657.aspx), [Jeff
Atwood](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/) asks the pertinent question
(and I’m paraphrasing here).

> Why the hell do I care what you were listening to when you wrote that
> post?

I attempted some bullshit answer about how writing is art and music
influences art. Blah blah blah.

However, in an attempt at introspection and honesty, the real answer is:

> **Because I’m an egomaniacal Bandwagon jumper!**

Yeah, that’s right! I saw some others do it, so I started doing it. I
jumped on the bandwagon.

The egomaniacal aspect relates to the belief that someday, I am going to
be so freaking famous that everyone will scour my trash to discover what
brand of floss I use. Even more, they’ll want to know what music I
listened to when I wrote. They’ll have college courses where they
deconstruct my writings in the context of the music I was listening to
at the time. They’ll even write alternative histories such as...

> How would the texture of the article on the Poor Management Epidemic
> have changed were he listening to Rage Against The Machine when he
> wrote it as opposed to Röyksopp?

Oh yes, it will happen. Oh yes. Just you watch Jeff.
