Since I have a free moment (and the internet connection is back up), I
thought I’d write a short status update of my trip to Japan. But first,
let me point out that I used the term “status update”. What am I? A
project manager?

In any case, we’re having a pretty nice time. Below is a little mural of
photos I’ve taken thus far. Yes, I have been suppressing my Asian side
by not being quite as trigger happy as one would expect.

### Meguro Gajoen

One of the highlights so far was our one night stay at the [Meguro
Gajoen](http://www.megurogajoen.co.jp/) ![Spirited Away
Bridge](http://haacked.com/images/SpiritedAwayBridge.jpg)a luxury hotel
that served as the inspiration for the location of the movie *Sen to
Chihiro no kamikakushi*, otherwise known as *[Spirited
Away](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0245429/)*. This place was one large
museum piece. For example, though it is a bit dark, the picture to the
right is of the main lobby bathroom. Notice it has a freaking bridge in
there! Does that bridge look familiar?

The lobby of this place was breathtaking with its collection of
historical artifacts, paintings, a pathway with water on both sides.
Check out that archway within the lobby walkway. Notice the water on the
left and right corners. The place even had waterfalls in its garden.

Much of the original hotel grounds had to be razed due to an encroaching
river. We took a tour of the original section that was spared the
destruction due to its distance from the river. [![100
Steps](http://photos21.flickr.com/29891947_bd5fcf600a_m.jpg)](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/29891947/ "Photo Sharing")To
the left, you can see a picture of the famous 100 stairs. It turns out
that there are only 99, according to our tour guide. I personally think
they should add one just to be honest. In any case, I did remember this
staircase from the movie.

I also remembered this main lobby area from the movie, when all the
strange inhabitants of the inn gathered together.
