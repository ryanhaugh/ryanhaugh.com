Or a better question that Jon Galloway asks is “What are many blogs
worth?” Specifically he [answers this question for every
blog](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/11/04/429559.aspx)
in the [weblogs.asp.net
OPML](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2005/11/04/weblogs.asp.net/opml.aspx).
Awesome work!

Since I don’t subscribe to that entire OPML, this might be an
interesting way to figure out which new blogs are worth checking out.
I’ll just sort on the worth and if it is worth alot, I’ll give it a
look.
