[Scoble](http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/) has posted [Steve Ballmer's
email](http://channel9.msdn.com/ShowPost.aspx?PostID=65966#65966) on
public policy engagement and outlines the thought process [behind the
reversal](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/06/3040.aspx).

After reading the email, I just have to say, much props and kudos to you
Steve and Microsoft! One of the key points Steve makes is...

> After looking at the question from all sides, Ive concluded that
> diversity in the workplace is such an important issue for our business

It highlights that social responsibility is good for business.

This devotion to diversity, frankly, is heartwarming and uplifting. As a
"mixbreed", I'm all over diversity. The more colors the better (although
that doesn't always apply to web design people). Reading Ballmer's email
made me feel that Microsoft might actually be a great place to work. And
that's a good thing for Microsoft. To be seen as a progressive workplace
will invite the best and the brightest. As will shipping timely solid
software. One down and one to go.
