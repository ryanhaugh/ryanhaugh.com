UPDATE: The MVC Futures assembly, `Microsoft.Web.Mvc` is [available on
CodePlex](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=18459 "MVC Futures on CodePlex").

Wanted to provide a quick heads up about the MvcFutures assembly within
[ASP.NET MVC CodePlex Preview
5](http://www.codeplex.com/aspnet/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=16775 "P5 Installer").
As mentioned in various places, this assembly contains various
experimental features we are considering for future versions of ASP.NET
MVC.

When we release the BETA for ASP.NET MVC, it will not automatically be
included in the project template by the installer. Weâ€™ve included it in
the various previews for convenience, but we want the BETA installer to
be as close to the RTM installer experience as possible.

We will make sure that the assembly remains [available on
CodePlex](http://codeplex.com/aspnet "ASP.NET on CodePlex"). I just
wanted to make you aware of this so there is no surprises when we
release the Beta regarding this. Thanks!
