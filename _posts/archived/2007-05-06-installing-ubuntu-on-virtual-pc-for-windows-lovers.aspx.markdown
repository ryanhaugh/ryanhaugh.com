I am a total
[noob](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=noob "Definition of noob - Someone who is new to something.")
when it comes to working with Linux. The only experience I have with
Unix is in college when I used to pipe the manual of `trn` via the
`write` command to unsuspecting classmates. If I remember correctly,
this is how you do it.

`write username | man trn`

This would fill the user’s screen with a bunch of text. Always good for
a laugh.

Normally, the `write` command informs the receiver who originated the
message. I remember there was some way to hide who I was when sending
the message, but have since forgotten that trick. Yep, them are some
true ! Good times! Good times!! Good times! Good times!

As usual, I digress.

I recently decided to try out Ubuntu to see what all the fuss was about.
My notes here apply to Virtual PC 2007.

### Downloading Ubuntu and Setting up the VPC

To start, download the iso image from the Ubuntu [download
site](http://www.ubuntu.com/getubuntu/download "Download Ubuntu"). I
downloaded the 7.04 version first since I assumed the bigger the version
number, the better, right? We’ll see this isn’t always the case as we’ll
see.

For completeness, I also installed 6.06.

When creating a new Virtual PC, make sure to bump up the ram to at least
256 MB of memory. Also make sure there is enough disk space. I tried to
skimp and had a problem with the install. If in doubt, use the default
value for disk space.

### Installing Ubuntu

After creating a new Virtual PC machine, select the *CD* menu and then
*Capture ISO Image* and browse for the iso image you downloaded.

![Virtual PC Capture ISO Image
Menu](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/InstallingUbuntuonVirtualPCforWindowsLov_C436/image033.png)

When the Ubuntu menu comes up, make sure to select *Start Ubuntu in Safe
Graphics Mode*. I’ll explain why later.

![Ubuntu startup

At this point, Ubuntu boots up and if you’re a total noob like me, you
might think “Wow! That was a fast install!”.

It turns out that this is Ubuntu running off the CD. I must’ve been
tired at the time because this confounded me for a good while as
everytime I rebooted, I lost all progress I was making. ;) The next step
is to *really* perform the install.

### The Mouse Capture Issue

If you’re running Ubuntu 7.04, you might run into an issue where you
can’t use the mouse in the VPC. This is due to a bug in some Linux
distros where it cannot find PS/2 mice, which is the type that VPC
emulates.

[This post has a
workaround](http://arcanecode.wordpress.com/2007/04/25/ubuntu-704-and-virtual-pc-2007-mouse-issue-workaround-sort-of/ "Ubuntu 7.04 and Virtual PC 2007 Mouse Issue Workaround")
for dealing with this issue by using the keyboard until these distros
are fixed. Heck, this might be a great *feature* of 7.04 since it forces
you to [go commando and learn the keyboard
shortcuts](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/archives/000825.html "Going Commando - Put Down The Mouse").

Ubuntu 6.06 does not suffer from this problem, so it may be a better
starting point if you and the mouse have a great rapport.

### The Real Install

At this point, you are ready to start the install. From the top level
*System* menu, select *Administration* | *Install*.

![Starting the
Install](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/InstallingUbuntuonVirtualPCforWindowsLov_C436/image08.png)

The installation process asks you a few simple questions and doesn’t
take too long.

### The Bit Depth Issue

Earlier I mentioned making sure to start Ubuntu in Safe Graphics Mode.
The reason for this is that the default bit depth property for Ubuntu is
24, which Virtual PC does not support. If you fail to heed this advice,
you’ll see something like this. Kind of looks like that [All Your Base
Are Belong to
Us](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_your_base_are_belong_to_us "All Your base on Wikipedia")
video.

![Ubuntu without the proper printer
settings](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/InstallingUbuntuonVirtualPCforWindowsLov_C436/image029.png)

Fortunately, I found the fix [in this
post](http://weblogs.asp.net/pscott/archive/2005/10/13/427426.aspx "Installing Ubuntu on Virtual PC 2004")
on Phil Scott’s blog (Phils rule!).**I bolded the essential elements.

When I ran through these steps, I found that I had to use the `sudo`
command (runs the command as a super user) first. For example:

`sudo pico xorg.conf`

Your results may vary. *Speaking of `sudo`,*[*have you seen my
t-shirt*](http://www.flickr.com/photo_zoom.gne?id=480589091&size=l "Sudo T-Shirt")*from*[*XKCD.com*](http://xkcd.com/ "XKCD.com geek comics website")*?*

### Virtual Machine Additions for Linux

At this point, you’ll probably want to install the Virtual Machine
Additions. Unfortunately, the additions only work for Windows and OS/2
guest operating systems.

However, you can go to the Connect website and download Virtual Machine
Additions for Linux. It took me a while to find [the actual download
link](https://connect.microsoft.com/Downloads/Downloads.aspx?SiteID=154 "Download Virtual Machine Additions for Linux")
because various blog posts only mentioned the Connect site and not the
actual location.

Ubuntu isn’t listed in the list of supported distributions. I’ll let you
know if it works for Ubuntu.

### Now What?

So now I have Ubuntu running in a virtual machine. It comes with Open
Office, Firefox, etc... preinstalled. My next step is to install VMWare
and MonoDevelop and start tinkering around. Any suggestions on what else
I should check out?

UPDATE: Perhaps I should use VMWare 6 instead since it [supports
multi-monitor in a virtual
machine](http://www.bytefx.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,2495e9f2-0a02-4cef-99b1-4ed7ed1cd644.aspx "VMWare 6 Rocks").
That’s hot!
