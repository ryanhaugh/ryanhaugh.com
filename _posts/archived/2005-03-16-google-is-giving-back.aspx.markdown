Looks like Google is responding to [some
critics](http://blog.kowalczyk.info/archives/2004/12/29/google-we-take-it-all-give-nothing-back/)
who say Google takes all and doesn't give back to the open source
community. They've just launched [Google Code](http://code.google.com/),
Google's place for Open Source software.

From their FAQ:

> What is code.google.com?\
>  Code.google.com is our site for external developers interested in
> Google-related development. Its where well publish free source code
> and lists of our API services. \
> \
>  Who are the people behind code.google.com?\
>  A lot of people worked together to both prepare source code for
> release and prepare code.google.com for launch and ongoing
> maintenance. We really care about free and open source software
> (F/OSS) at Google, and this site is one aspect of that affection.
