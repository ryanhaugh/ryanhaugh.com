Raise your hand if you know how to validate an email address. For those
of you with your hand in the air, put it down quickly before someone
sees you. It’s an odd sight to see someone sitting alone at the keyboard
raising his or her hand. I was speaking metaphorically.

[![at-sign](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/IThoughtIKnewHowToValidateAnEmailAddress_E977/at-sign_1.jpg)](http://www.stockxpert.com/browse.phtml?f=profile&l=ErickN "At Sign from stockxpert by ErickN")
Before yesterday I would have raised my hand (metaphorically) as well. I
needed to validate an email address on the server. Something I’ve done a
hundred thousand times (seriously, I counted) using a handy dandy
regular expression in my personal library.

This time, for some reason, I decided to take a look at my underlying
assumptions. I had never actually read (or even skimmed) the RFC for an
email address. I simply based my implementation on my preconceived
assumptions about what makes a valid email address. You know what they
say [about
assuming](http://jyte.com/cl/when-you-assume-you-make-an-ass-out-of-you-and-me "saying about assumptions").

**What I found out was surprising. Nearly 100% of regular expressions on
the web purporting to validate an email address are too strict.**

It turns out that the local part of an email address, the part before
the @ sign, allows a lot more characters than you’d expect. According to
section 2.3.10 of RFC 2821 which defines SMTP, the part before the @
sign is called the local part (the part after being the host domain) and
it is only intended to be interpreted by the receiving host...

> Consequently, and due to a long history of problems when intermediate
> hosts have attempted to optimize transport by modifying them, **the
> local-part MUST be interpreted and assigned semantics only by the host
> specified in the domain part of the address**.

Section [section
3.4.1](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.4.1 "Section 3.4.1 of rfc2822")
of [RFC
2822](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822 "RFC 2822 Internet Message Format") goes
into more detail about the specification of an email address (emphasis
mine).

> An addr-spec is a specific Internet identifier that contains a locally
> interpreted string followed by the at-sign character ("@", ASCII value
> 64) followed by an Internet domain.  The locally interpreted string is
> either a **quoted-string** or a **dot-atom**.

A *dot-atom* is a dot delimited series of atoms. An *atom* is defined in
[section
3.2.4](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#3.2.4 "Section 3.2.4 Atom") as
a series of alphanumeric characters and may include the following
characters (*all the ones you need to swear in a comic strip*)...

> ! \$ & \* - = \^ \` | \~ \# % ' + / ? \_ { }

Not only that, but it’s also valid (though not recommended and very
uncommon) to have quoted local parts which allow pretty much any
character. Quoting can be done via the backslash character (what is
commonly known as escaping) or via surrounding the local part in double
quotes.

[RFC
3696](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3696 "Clarification of internet mailing specs"),
*Application Techniques for Checking and Transformation of Names*, was
written by the author of the SMTP protocol ([RFC
2821](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2821 "RFC 2821 SMTP")) as a human
readable guide to SMTP. In section 3, he gives some examples of valid
email addresses.

**These are all valid email addresses!**

-   "Abc\\@def"@example.com
-   "Fred Bloggs"@example.com
-   "Joe\\\\Blow"@example.com
-   "Abc@def"@example.com
-   customer/department=shipping@example.com
-   \$A12345@example.com
-   !def!xyz%abc@example.com
-   \_somename@example.com

*Note: Gotta love the author for using my favorite example person, Joe
Blow*.

Quick, run these through your favorite email validation method. Do they
all pass?

For fun, I decided to try and write a regular expression ([yes, I know I
now have two problems.
Thanks.](http://regex.info/blog/2006-09-15/247 "Source of the famous 'Now you have two problems' quote")) that
would validate all of these. Here’s what I came up with. (The part in
bold is the *local part*. I am not worrying about checking my
assumptions for the *domain part* for now.)

`` ^(?!\.)("([^"\r\\]|\\["\r\\])*"|([-a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~] |(?@[a-z0-9][\w\.-]*[a-z0-9]\.[a-z][a-z\.]*[a-z]$ ``

Note that this expression assumes case insensitivity options are turned
on (*RegexOptions.IgnoreCase for .NET*). Yeah, that’s a pretty ugly
expression.

I wrote a unit test to demonstrate all the cases this test covers. Each
row below is an email address and whether it should be valid or not.

```csharp
[RowTest]
[Row(@"NotAnEmail", false)]
[Row(@"@NotAnEmail", false)]
[Row(@"""test\\blah""@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"""test\blah""@example.com", false)]
[Row("\"test\\\rblah\"@example.com", true)]
[Row("\"test\rblah\"@example.com", false)]
[Row(@"""test\""blah""@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"""test""blah""@example.com", false)]
[Row(@"customer/department@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"$A12345@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"!def!xyz%abc@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"_Yosemite.Sam@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"~@example.com", true)]
[Row(@".wooly@example.com", false)]
[Row(@"wo..oly@example.com", false)]
[Row(@"pootietang.@example.com", false)]
[Row(@".@example.com", false)]
[Row(@"""Austin@Powers""@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"Ima.Fool@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"""Ima.Fool""@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"""Ima Fool""@example.com", true)]
[Row(@"Ima Fool@example.com", false)]
public void EmailTests(string email, bool expected)
{
  string pattern = @"^(?!\.)(""([^""\r\\]|\\[""\r\\])*""|" 
    + @"([-a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~]|(?<!\.)\.)*)(?<!\.)" 
    + @"@[a-z0-9][\w\.-]*[a-z0-9]\.[a-z][a-z\.]*[a-z]$";

  Regex regex = new Regex(pattern, RegexOptions.IgnoreCase);
  Assert.AreEqual(expected, regex.IsMatch(email)
    , "Problem with '" + email + "'. Expected "  
    + expected + " but was not that.");
}
```

Before you call me a completely anal nitpicky numnut (you might be
right, but wait anyways), I don’t think this level of detail in email
validation is absolutely necessary. Most email providers have stricter
rules than are required for email addresses. For example, Yahoo requires
that an email start with a letter. There seems to be a standard stricter
set of rules most email providers follow, but as far as I can tell it is
undocumented.

I think I’ll sign up for an email address like
*phil.h\\@\\@ck@haacked.com* and start bitching at sites that require
emails but don’t let me create an account with this new email address.
Ooooooh I’m such a troublemaker.

The lesson here is that it is healthy to challenge your preconceptions
and assumptions once in a while and to never let me near an RFC.

UPDATES: Corrected some mistakes I made in reading the RFC. See! Even
after reading the RFC I still don’t know what the hell I’m doing! Just
goes to show that [programmers can’t
read](http://haacked.com/archive/2007/02/27/Why_Cant_Programmers._Read.aspx "Why Can’t Programmers... Read?").
I updated the post to point to [RFC
822](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc822.html "RFC 822 Standard for the format of ARPA Internet Text Messages")
as well. The *original* RFC.
