[Jim Holmes](http://frazzleddad.blogspot.com/ "Jim Holmes") and [James
Avery](http://dotavery.com/blog/ "James Avery") announced that their new
book *[Windows Developer Power
Tools](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596527543/sr=8-1/qid=1152586726/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-4205038-6871900?redirect=true&ie=UTF8 "Preorder at Amazon")*
is going to be published in November.

Since I haven’t read the book yet, I cannot claim it will absolutely be
*the* must read book of the summer. But I have a good feeling about this
one for some reason.

Ok. Ok. I admit, I am biased because I am a contributor. Take a look at
the [table of contents
here](http://iterativerose.com/WinDevPowerTools/TOC.aspx "Contents"). My
contributions are in Chapter 11, “Accessing Subversion and CVS with
TortoiseSVN/CVS” as well as in Chapter 13 where I wrote about one of my
favorite topics, [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext").

I also reviewed the chapter on [MbUnit](http://mbunit.com/ "MbUnit")
with [Andrew
Stopford](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/archive/2006/07/13/Windows-Devloper-Power-Tools-book.aspx "Andrew Stopford's Blog").

Having seen a couple other draft chapters, I am really excited about
this book and not just because I contributed. Open source projects can
be notorious for lacking in documentation. I can’t be sure, but I
imagine that this book may be the impetus for some of these projects to
actually write some documentation. But I am going out on a limb by
saying that.

My contribution to this book is much more significant and original than
my pseudo-contribution to [another book this
year](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/04/30/ASP.NETMVPHaacked.aspx "ASP.NET MVP Hacks").
