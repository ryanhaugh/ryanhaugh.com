For as smart a guy as Joel Spolsky supposedly is, you’d think he’d keep
his dumb ass remarks off his blog and between himself and his interns.

In his latest [ego-inflating piece of verbal
masturbation](http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/HighNotes.html),
Joel insults the internal corporate developer.

Now, let’s put aside for the moment the arguments on how outstanding
internal developers are just as important as outstanding shrink wrap
developers. Scott Reynolds does a [nice job covering
that](http://www.scottcreynolds.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=839a3eac-29a8-462d-9425-55f946c90a0e).

The real question here is just *who on god’s green Earth does Joel think
makes the recommendation to buy his bug tracking and content management
software?* It certainly isn’t management or the Linus Torvalds of the
world clamoring for FogBugz. Hmmm, call it a hunch, but I would imagine
a large proportion of his sales come from internal corporate developers.
So how much sense does it make to give them the big middle finger while
sitting smugly cloistered away in your ivory tower divorced from
reality?

Now I agree with his general point, that if you’re in the business of
software, you should hire the best programmers you can get. I don’t
think his goal was to alienate corporate developers, but to illustrate
one unique aspect of how hiring the best applies to shrink-wrapped
software.

Where I disagree is his casual dismissal of non-shrink-wrap developers.
Hitting the high notes isn’t always about creating emotional appeal with
a shrink wrap product. Sometimes it’s solving an engineering problem in
such a creative or elegant manner so that millions are saved, or in the
case of Apollo 13, lives are saved.

How about this for a principle, *For many internal developers, millions
of dollars, the entire business, even lives may be at stake (for
example, the Shuttle programmers), all resting on the integrity of a
single copy of unique software. How is the best any less needed in this
scenario?*.

I could say more, but I need some sleep. I’ve got a plane to catch.
