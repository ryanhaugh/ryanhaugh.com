Consider this a more advanced followup to my [Quickstart Guide to Open
Source Development With CVS and
SourceForge](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/12/3178.aspx).

### Intro

So you have finally decided to become a flower power card carrying
community loving member of an an open source project that happens to be
hosted on [Sourceforge](http://sourceforge.net/ "SourceForge"). Good for
you! Unfortunately, someone might expect you to actually contribute
something. Suppose they give you the responsibility to update the
project Home Page. SourceForge provides the ability to host project home
pages within SourceForge itself, but how do you access those files? This
guide will help you with that so you can earn the respect of your peers
and graduate from n00b to contributor.

First, it is important to understand that you will not be able to
fallback on your trusty FTP client to move your files to your
SourceForge website. If you are a Windows developer unnaccustomed to the
\*nix-y ways of doing things (\*nix == unix, linux, anyothernix...),
it’s time to get the hands a bit dirty. But don’t you worry, I’ll
present the most Windowsy manner to get \*nixy tasks done.

To access files on SourceForge, you are going to have connect to their
shell services via an SSH session. SSH is a protocol which is analogous
to, but different from FTP. Some applications adopt this protocol to
provide secure communication between servers, such as SFTP (secure FTP)
and SCP (secure copy). Applications which are not built on SSH can still
use these services by communicating through an SSH tunnel.

### WinSCP To Securely Transfer Files

The quick and easy way to do this for those of us who don’t work with
\*nix every day is to download and install
[WinSCP](http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/winscp/winscp380setup.exe?download "WinSCP used for secure file transfer").
WinSCP is both a SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol) and SCP (Secure Copy
Protocol) client.

### SourceForge Project Shell Info

Before you start with WinSCP, you’ll need [some
information](https://sourceforge.net/docs/E07#shell) about your
SourceForge project handy. Remember, as with all things \*nix,
everything is case sensitive.

> -   Hostname: **shell.sourceforge.net** (or shell.sf.net)
> -   Username: as used to login to the SourceForge.net web site.
> -   Password: Password authentication is not supported. You must
>     configure a SSH key pair for authentication.
> -   Project Group Directory: **/home/groups/P/PR/PROJECTNAME**
> -   Project Web Directory (root):
>     **/home/groups/P/PR/PROJECTNAME/htdocs**
> -   Project Web CGI Script Directory:
>     **/home/groups/P/PR/PROJECTNAME/cgi-bin**

For example, these values for me on Subtext are...

> -   Hostname: **shell.sourceforge.net** (or shell.sf.net)
> -   Username: **haacked**
> -   Password: *leave blank*
> -   Project Group Directory: **/home/groups/s/su/subtext**
> -   Project Web Directory (root): **/home/groups/s/su/subtext/htdocs**
> -   Project Web CGI Script Directory:
>     **/home/groups/s/su/subtext/cgi-bin**

### Using WinSCP

When WinSCP first starts, you will see a dialog box that requests
various host information. Enter the following details in to the provided
dialog box:

-   Host name: **shell.sourceforge.net** (or cf-shell.sourceforge.net)
-   Port number: **22**
-   User name: **YOUR\_USERNAME**
-   Password: *leave this field blank*
-   Private key file: **Click on the "..." button to browse for the
    PuTTY private key you created previously [following the instructions
    here](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/12/3178.aspx). Load the
    desired key.**
-   Protocol: **SFTP (allow SCP fallback)**

Below is a screenshot of this dialog and how I entered the fields.

![](http://haacked.com/images/WinSCPSessionCreation.gif)

Click **Save** and choose the default for the session name which should
matche the hostname you entered previously
(USERNAME@shell.sourceforge.net or USERNAME@cf-shell.sourceforge.net).

To start the session, click the **Login** button. The first time you do
this for a session, you will get a dialog asking to compare the SSH host
key fingerprint. This is to make sure you are connecting to the site you
think you are connecting to.

If you followed the instructions as I described, you should see the
following key:

    4c:68:03:d4:5c:58:a6:1d:9d:17:13:24:14:48:ba:99

If yours differs, compare it against [the list of keys
here](https://sourceforge.net/docs/G04/en/#ssh_hostkey). If it does not
match, please contact SourceForge.net staff by submitting a Support
Request.

Once you are logged in, you can browse your project directories. Browse
to your project root and if you choose the Explorer view as I did, it
should look like the screenshot below.

![WinSCP ScreenShot](http://haacked.com/images/WinSCPScreenshot.gif)

Place your web files within the hcp directory. Unfortunately at the time
of this writing, SourceForge won’t run .NET code, but it does support
cgi as well as PHP and MySQL.
