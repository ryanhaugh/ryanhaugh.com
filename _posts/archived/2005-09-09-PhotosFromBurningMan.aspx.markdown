I caught a brutal cold on my return from Black Rock City, so I haven’t
been much in the blogging mood. But I’m starting to feel better (or the
glass of Sake is really working its magic) and thought I’d post a quick
blurb about the trip.

For those of you who have never heard of Burning Man, the wikipedia [has
a pretty decent entry on it](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_man).
For more information, I would also recommend checking out the [Burning
Man website](http://www.burningman.com/). For an über geek perspective,
check out [Chris Sell’s
writeup](http://www.sellsbrothers.com/fun/burningman/).

To me, Burning Man is a temporary community that comes closer than any
other community I have been apart of to embodying inclusion. Radical
Inclusion is one of the [ten guiding
principles](http://www.burningman.com/whatisburningman/about_burningman/principles.html)
of Burning Man. It may sound somewhat utopian, but it works pretty well
in the small scale.

First, before I forget as I tend to do, let me post a [link to my photos
from Burning Man](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/sets/903649/)
hosted on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/). Just seeing for
yourself is another great way to learn about it.

The thing that most impressed me about Burning Man my first time was the
sheer amount of creativity that seemed to explode across the desert.
Again, this year I was not disappointed.

What set my second time apart is that I knew more what to expect. Thus I
was more prepared to be involved in the festivities. Burning Man blurs
the line between participant and audience. There isn’t a sense of “Oh
THEY are performers and we are the audience.” Oh no no. Everyone is a
mix of both.

To that end I enjoyed diving into the scene with a costume here and
there such as this Black Rock City Jail jumpsuit. It was perfect for the
Orange party, with its squadron of orange nazis who only allowed those
fully in orange to enter.

For our annual luau, I made sure to bring my aloha shirt. Somehow I had
inadverdently made orange a bit of a theme for me this year. I would
have taken even more photos but my camera choked on some playa dust and
stopped working. That sucked.

I won’t go into much detail about Burning Man this year, but I will
mention that one of the more memorable highlights were seeing such big
name DJs as Paul Oakenfold and Tiësto perform. True to Burning Man
spirit, they performed for free and paid their own way to the event.
Tiësto even made a donation to the hosting camp as they were in depth
from all their efforts to put on such a good show. You have to realize
these guys regularly command somewhere in the \$30K to \$40K range for a
two hour set at a normal club.

Among other highlights was the fact that this was my buddy Kyle’s first
time. I’m pretty sure he had a good time. It is late and I leave you
with a pic of the trike that our buddy Dane built. That’s me in the
front pedalling these lazy fools around.
