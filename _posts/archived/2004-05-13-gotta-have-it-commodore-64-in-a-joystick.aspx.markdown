![C64 mini](/images/tlp_joystick_front.gif)This [press
release](http://www.tulip.com/news/article.asp?nid=147) announced a
joystick that has a C64 mini console in a Joystick with 30 games
including California Games. I absolutely loved California Games!
Especially hacky-sack and surfing.

Man, I need to dust off my Amiga and get that guy up and running again.
