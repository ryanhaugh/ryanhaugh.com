> There are by some estimates more than a million weblogs. But most of
> them get no visibility in search engines. Only a few "A-List" blogs
> get into the top search engine results for a given topic, while the
> majority of blogs just don't get noticed. The reason is that the
> smaller blogs don't have enough links pointing to them. But this
> posting could solve that. Let's help the smaller blogs get more
> visibility!
>
> This posting is [GoMeme
> 4.0](http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/what_is_a_gomem.html).
> It is part of an experiment to see if we can create a blog posting
> that helps 1000's of blogs get higher rankings in Google. So far we
> have tried 3 earlier variations. Our first test, [GoMeme
> 1.0](http://novaspivack.typepad.com/nova_spivacks_weblog/2004/08/a_sonar_ping_of.html),
> spread to nearly 740 blogs in 2.5 days. This new version 4.0 is
> shorter, simpler, and fits more easily into your blog.
>
> Why are we doing this? We want to help thousands of blogs get more
> visibility in Google and other search engines. How does it work? Just
> follow the instructions below to re-post this meme in your blog and
> add your URL to the end of the Path List below. As the meme spreads
> onwards from your blog, so will your URL. Later, when your blog is
> indexed by search engines, they will see the links pointing to your
> blog from all the downstream blogs that got this via you, which will
> cause them to rank your blog higher in search results. Everyone in the
> Path List below benefits in a similar way as this meme spreads. Try
> it!
>
> **Instructions:** Just copy this entire post and paste it into your
> blog. Then add your URL to the end of the path list below, and pass it
> on! (Make sure you add your URLs as live links or HTML code to the
> Path List below.)
