![Spam](/images/spam.jpg) For the past few months I've been teaching
myself Longhorn programming via the PDC bits by building a better Spam
filter. Some of the best filters will typically use an approach based on
Bayesian probability modeling. For example, in this
[article](http://www.paulgraham.com/better.html "Better Bayesian Filtering")
Paul Graham discusses an improved algorithm for filtering spam

Although I am currently a software engineer (and manager) by trade, my
background is in Mathematics and I'm not entirely satisfied with the
current crop of spam filters. I realized that mathematical analysis
alone isn't enough. There has to be an "intelligence" factor.

The app I'm working on takes the Bayesian approach, but integrates that
with intelligent filtering by taking advantage of the cheap cost of
outsourcing and the proliferation of peer-to-peer software (made easier
by Indigo I might add). You can see my new [spam filter
here](/SpamFilter.htm "New Spam Filter").
