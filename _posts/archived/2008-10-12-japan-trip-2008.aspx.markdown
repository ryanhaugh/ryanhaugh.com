Just got back from our trip to latest Japan yesterday morning. On
previous trips, I [ate really great
Yakitori](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/08/05/dreamingofyakitori.aspx "Yakitori"),
[ate Blowfish and lived to tell about
it](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/09/i-ate-blowfish.aspx "Eating Blowfish"),
[celebrated the new
year](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/01/new-year-in-tokyo.aspx "Celebrated the new year"),
, learned about ritual suicide and played around with [sharp
swords](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/01/04/on-seppuku-katanas-samurai.aspx "Seppuku Katanas"),
[visited a
temple](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/31/asakusa.aspx "Asakusa") in
the midst of old Tokyo, and visited the [hotel from Spirited
Away](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/07/31/spirited-away-hotel.aspx "Spirited Away").

[![Golden
Palace](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20748_thumb_1.jpg "Golden Palace")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20748_2.jpg)This
trip was mostly a relaxing affair consisting of eating good food and
lying around doing as much nothing as we could muster. Unfortunately,
travelling with a 15 month old child meant that the amount of actual
relaxation to be had was certain to be capped.

The most exciting part of the trip was my first ever visit to Kyoto, a
beautiful city full of Shinto shrines and beautiful temples. It is also
the namesake of the [Kyoto
Protocol](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kyoto_Protocol "Kyoto Protocol").

[![Japan Trip
763](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20763_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 763")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20763.jpg)I’ve
uploaded a fair amount of photos to
[FaceBook](http://facebook.com/ "Facebook"), but I thought I’d share a
few here along with a brief commentary. These first two shots are of a
stunning building covered in gold leaf. The leaf is very securely
fastened to the building. Don’t ask me how I know that.

Apparently, there’s a silver temple in Kyoto as well, but the guy
building it ran out of money before it was ever covered in silver.

While in Kyoto, we stayed at the Westin Miyako Kyoto. They have two
types of rooms, the traditional western style you all know and love, and
the Japanese style as seen in this next photo, exquisitely modeled by my
son. These consist of a single large simple room. At night, they put
away the table and chairs and lay down [tatami
mats](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tatami "Tatami on Wikipedia").

[![Japan Trip
660](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20660_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 660")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20660.jpg)

Thankfully, the toilet was western style because I’m not so talented at
squatting.

The landscaping and natural beauty of many of the shrines and temples
were simply astounding. And it’s no accident. We saw one guy
painstakingly hand picking out tiny little weeds on a huge lawn.

[![Japan Trip
674](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20674_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 674")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20674.jpg)One
of the highlights of this trip was meeting Cody’s cousin, Rio, for the
first time.

[![Japan Trip
837](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20837_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 837")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20837.jpg)

 [![Japan Trip
802](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20802_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 802")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20802.jpg)
[![Japan Trip
686](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20686_thumb.jpg "Japan Trip 686")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/JapanTrip2008_E4B6/Japan%20Trip%20686.jpg)

As you can see in the photo, she’s already learned the fine art of
giving a *Wet-u Wirry* (Wet Willy in English). Perhaps that’s payback
for all the bear hugs Cody attempted to give her which ended becoming
football tackles.

In any case, if you’re ever taking a long trip to Japan, be sure to try
and fit Kyoto into your itinerary. I really love Tokyo for its Blade
Runneresque hyper neon modernism, which makes a visit to Kyoto so
complementary for its ancient feeling.
