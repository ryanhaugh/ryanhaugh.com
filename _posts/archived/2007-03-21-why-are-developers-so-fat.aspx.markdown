[Raymond
Lewallen](http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/ "Raymond Lewallen's blog")
doesn’t mean to single anybody out, but in his latest post on the topic
of [living
better](http://codebetter.com/blogs/raymond.lewallen/archive/2007/03/20/Don_2700_t-just-CodeBetter_2C00_-LiveBetter-too_2100_.aspx "Don't just code better, live better!"),
he observes that

So based on events at a geek conference, the MVP summit, Raymond assumes
that unhealthy diets and lack of exercise could be at fault. Let me
propose another theory based on my experience today on the exhibition
floor of the [SD West
conference](http://www.sdexpo.com/ "SD West conference website").

As is common at conferences, several booths were giving out those
ubiquitous one-size-fits all X-Large t-shirts emblazoned with a flaccid
attempt at being hip and witty. All of this is lost on me as I receive a
shirt I will never wear, as it looks like a dress on me. At least it
will make a good rag for cleaning the next spill on my kitchen floor.

Contrast this to when I head over to
[SourceGear’s](http://sourcegear.com/ "SourceGear the Company") booth. I
had the great pleasure to meet the founder of SourceGear, [Eric
Sink](http://software.ericsink.com/ "Eric.Weblog"), in person. He is the
author of one of my favorite blogs, in which he writes insightful posts
on running a software company and software development in general.

*Interesting random connection to Eric: He and I discovered that we both
lived in the*[*same apartment complex in
Spain*](http://www.flickr.com/photos/haacked/tags/torrejon/ "Flickr - Torrejon, Spain Pictures")*,
but at different times.*

Back to the story. **They actually are giving out shirts that I would
consider wearing outside of a conference hall.** He asks if I would like
one, to which I reply, "Sure!". It’s his next question that throws me
aback.

> Which size would you like?

*Uh...excuse me. What was that?*

**You see, SourceGear had shirts in all sizes!** Not only that, they had
an ingenious ploy to get everyone wearing them. They were giving out a
Wii and said they would randomly walk around and give people wearing the
t-shirt tickets for the Wii raffle. Near the end of the day, it seemed
like everyone was wearing their shirt.

Then it occurred to me. Developers are so used to being fit into a
single mold, we often don't know better. We often do that to our users,
forcing them to conform to our software rather than conforming our
software to how users really work.

In the keynote, David Platt gave several examples of sites that work and
don’t work. Using the Starbucks website as an example, he did a search
for one in his area. It didn’t find one within the selected radius, 5
miles, and gave him an empty search result page asking him to search
again. Come again?

As Platt points out, when you’re in need of a coffe, would you ask your
friend, “Hey, where are all the Starbucks within five miles from here?”,
or do you ask, “Hey, where is the nearest Starbucks?” and *then* make
the decision to go or not based on that information. You do the latter
and so should our software.

But I digress.

Getting back to my epiphany. **It occurred to me that maybe developers
are fat, because we’re all trying to fit into that X-Large conference
t-shirt**. Perhaps, if more companies focus on the user like SourceGear,
we’ll see thinner developers wearing shirts that actually fit. Just
maybe.

If so, remember to thank Eric for giving developers a reason to not get
fat.
