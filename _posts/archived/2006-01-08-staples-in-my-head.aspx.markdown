When you hear the phrase, “use your head” you are typically being told
to think. There are other uses of the head that are quite unwise. For
example, trying to clear a soccer ball away from another player rushing
in on the attack when you are a step too late. Unfortunately that’s
exactly what I tried today.

My head just happened to get in the way of the shoulder of the onrushing
soccer player when we both jumped to try and win the ball. It was really
no contest as his shoulder won, leaving a nice inch long laceration on
top of my scalp. Fortunately it wasn’t very deep and I was not knocked
unconscious, though I bled a lot and had a nice Tom & Jerry bump on the
head.

This earned me a trip to the ER which is NOTHING like the TV show. If it
were, the show would have been cancelled after the first episode. I fail
to see how interesting a show would be where the patients wait around
for four hours before a doctor sees them to perform a grand total of
five to ten minutes of actual work.

In any case, the extremely busy doctor made quick work of cleaning out
the wound and stapling it shut with two painful squeezes of the stapler
(no local anesthesia). I hadn’t realized how helpful office supplies
could be when applied to the head.

The doctor said I show no signs of a concussion and should be ready to
play again in a few days as soon as I feel comfortable. I’m glad I’ll be
able to play next week, but I won’t be using my head as much.
