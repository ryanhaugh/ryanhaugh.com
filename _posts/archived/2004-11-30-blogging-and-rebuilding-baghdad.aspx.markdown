My neighbor Chris is in Iraq as the \#2 guy overseeing rebuilding
projects as part of the Army Corp of Engineer. He'll be over there for
several months helping to rebuild the facilities necessary for providing
clean drinking water and electricity.

Chris and his wife Susan are among the nicest people you will ever meet.
Their dog Nelson was kind enough to show Twiggy the ropes as it comes to
the best spots in the neighborhood for taking care of business. Susan is
always offering to take Twiggy for a walk when we're away at work.

In any case, with all the bad news coming from Iraq, it's good to read
about progress made in the rebuilding efforts. Here's a snippet about
his wild ride into Baghdad. Be glad your typical business trip doesn't
come with this sort of landing.

I've flown in a C-130 myself and can vouch for how uncomfortable a ride
it is. However, I've never experienced a landing quite like his.
