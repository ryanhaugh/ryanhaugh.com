![Web 2.11](http://haacked.com/images/Web211.jpg)Despite the apparent
hype factor of “Web 2.0”, I am really starting to get into the whole Web
2.0 phenomena. I think it really clicked when hearing about it in
various panel discussions at Mix06.

The foundations are quite simple. Web 2.0 is about:

-   User created content.
-   Using AJAX to make websites UI responsive
-   Providing simple Open APIs.
-   Harnessing collective intelligence
-   And so on...

But jumping on Web 2.0 now is like jumping on a hot stock. By the time
you’ve heard about it, so has everyone else. That information is
immediately absorbed by the stock market and reflected in its price. In
other words, you have already missed the boat sucka.

So I am letting you, my limited audience, in on a secret. The time is
now to leap ahead of your competition and embrace Web 2.1.

Web 2.0 is oh so five minutes ago. Now that Microsoft is joining the Web
2.0 fray, you know they are going to get it right. But they won’t get it
right in 2.0 (remember Windows 3.0 or .NET 1.0? Exactly). It is all
about adding the .1 baby!

At Mix 06, Microsoft unveiled their vision for the web, which seeing as
how their modern product versioning system works these days, will be
marketed as Web 2007. By the time it is released it will probably be
called Microsoft Web Based Collective Intelligence and Open API AJAX
Platform (or WBCIOAAP for short). I personally can appreciate the double
“A” thrown in there.

Some of the pillars of Web 2007 WBCIOAAP include the following:

-   Why stop at user generated crap? Animal generated content! Who
    better to fling crap on the web than animals?
-   AJAX is about making UI responsive. But why be so reactive? Web 2007
    introduces PRAJAX! It combines the power of prayer to create
    PRedictive AJAX. This stuff is going to rock!
-   Current efforts to harness collective intelligence makes the
    unreasonable assumption that everyone who contributes is equally
    intelligent. Well we know that ain’t true. Introducing the Microsoft
    Idiot Filter. If you are going to allow tagging, this software makes
    sure to filter out the idiots, leaving 5% of the tags, but a very
    intelligent 5%.
-   And so on...

I will be converting [my business](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT") and
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website") into a
Web 2007 application soon. What about you?
