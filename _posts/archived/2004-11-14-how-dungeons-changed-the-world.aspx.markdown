![AD&D](/images/ADAndD.jpg) I'll come out of the closet and admit that I
used to play this game with an almost fanatic interest. My first
exposure to the game was in Spain when several other military brats in
my apartment complex introduced me to a twenty sided die (1d20). By the
time I moved to Guam, I was hooked. I started a group there with an
unlikely band of friends: a Hawaiian volleyball player, half-thai
skateboarder dude, heavy metal rocker, etc... and we were destroyers of
worlds.

For many of these guys, the game was new to them and they didn't realize
that in many circles there was a stigma attached to those who played it.
I would cringe when hanging out with my other friends and these guys
would say, "Yeah, we're going to play Dungeons and Dragons tonight".
This was an unecessary side effect of youthful insecurity. I haven't
played in years as I've found that as people work full time and have
families, it's difficult to make the time. Even more difficult is to
have several people have the time at the same time. It's a feat of
synchronization. Perhaps when I retire.
