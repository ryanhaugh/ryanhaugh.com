UPDATE: I have an example [Really Empty project
template](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/01/11/a-really-empty-asp-net-mvc-3-project-template.aspx)
up on GitHub you can look at. I improved on this technique a bit in that
one.

When you create a new ASP.NET MVC 3 project, the new project wizard
dialog contains several options for different MVC project templates:

-   Empty
-   Internet Application
-   Intranet Application (new in the [April 2011 Tools
    update](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/04/12/introducing-asp-net-mvc-3-tools-update.aspx "ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update"))

There’s a lot of white space in that dialog. To many of you, all that
unsullied territory smells like opportunity. When I talk about this
dialog, I go to great pains to tell folks that, yes!, you too can extend
that dialog and add your own project templates in there.

If you wanted to, you could have your own ASP.NET MVC 3 project template
configured exactly the way you want. Hate the default template? Make
your own!

The only problem is, I keep telling you that you can extend it, but
sadly I never told you how. But that’s about to change!

I don’t expect that a large number of people will want to do this, which
is one reason we haven’t spent a large amount of time making it easy
(though that may change in the future). But for the few of you impatient
masochists who want to add your own custom templates now, this blog post
will walk you through the hacking around it takes to make it happen.

Imitation is the sincerest form of productivity
-----------------------------------------------

The easiest way to get started is to simply copy and modify an existing
project template. For example, I looked in the following directory:

*C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio
10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplates\\CSharp\\Web\\1033*

on my machine and ~~stole~~ \*ahem\* borrowed the project template named
*MvcWebApplicationProjectTemplatev3.01.cshtml.zip*. *Note that the 1033
folder is for English (en-US) templates. For other languages, you may
need to look in a different folder*.

I then renamed it to *MyProjectTemplate.cshtml.zip* and extracted the
contents into a folder so I could make some modifications to its
contents.

[![MyProjectTemplate.cshtml](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Creating-a-Cust.NET-MVC-Project-Template_12902/MyProjectTemplate.cshtml_thumb.png "MyProjectTemplate.cshtml")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Creating-a-Cust.NET-MVC-Project-Template_12902/MyProjectTemplate.cshtml_2.png)

When you extract the contents, you’ll want to rename the .vstemplate
file to match the name of the template you chose. In my case, I renamed
*MvcWebApplicationProjectTemplatev3.01.cshtml.vstemplate* to
*MyProjectTemplate.cshtml.vstemplate*.

Open up the .vstemplate file in NotePad and make sure to change the
`TemplateID` element value to something unique.

You can change any of the contents of the template folder now, but be
very careful to make sure that any additions or deletions of content are
reflected in the .vstemplate file. That file is a manifest of all the
files within the VSIX package that makes up the project template. Also
make sure that the *.csproj* file reflects those changes as well, to
ensure any new files you add to the template are properly referenced in
the project.

Pre-installed NuGet packages
----------------------------

UPDATE: The upcoming NuGet 1.5 feature will provide support for this
feature in a way that doesn’t require the following harsh warning.
Marcin Dobosz has a [blog post detailing the
feature](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/marcinon/archive/2011/07/08/project-templates-and-preinstalled-nuget-packages.aspx "Pre-installed packages for any project").

**Warning:** I probably shouldn’t show you this next section and some of
my co-workers may chide me on this. But if you promise to be responsible
and pay close attention to the information and *context for that
information* I’m about to show you, I’ll do it anyways and trust you not
to inundate us with support calls when this blows your hand off.

The ASP.NET MVC 3 Tools Update includes very **limited** support for
project templates that include NuGet packages. We originally wanted it
to be very extensible, but ran out of time and imposed some severe
limitations on the feature, hence the caution.

If you scroll to the bottom of the .vstemplate file, you’ll notice the
following section:

```csharp
<WizardData>
    <packages>
        <package id="jQuery" version="1.5.1" />
        <package id="jQuery.vsdoc" version="1.5.1" />
        <package id="jQuery.Validation" version="1.8.0" />
        <package id="jQuery.UI.Combined" version="1.8.11" />
        <package id="EntityFramework" version="4.1.10331.0" />
        <package id="Modernizr" version="1.7" />
    </packages>
</WizardData>
```

That is the list of NuGet packages that the MVC 3 project template
installs when you invoke the project template.

But as I mentioned, there are two major limitations:

-   The package must exist in the **%ProgramFiles%\\Microsoft
    ASP.NET\\ASP.NET MVC 3\\Packages** folder. MVC 3 doesn’t go
    searching online for them.
-   The `version` attribute of the package in the `<package>` element is
    required and is an exact match.

If you are fine with these limitations, you can modify this section of
your custom project template to install the NuGet packages you care
about. Just make sure they exist in the MVC 3 packages folder like I
mentioned.

Once you are done making your changes, zip up the contents of the folder
with the same file name you had before.

Registering your project template
---------------------------------

At this point, all you need to do is copy the project template to the
right location and add the appropriate registry entries. For extra
credit, you can write an installer (MSI) that does all this for you.

The place to copy your template is the same place I mentioned
previously, *C:\\Program Files (x86)\\Microsoft Visual Studio
10.0\\Common7\\IDE\\ProjectTemplates\\CSharp\\Web\\1033*

Once the template is there, you’ll need to setup the correct registry
settings.

![registry-editor](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Creating-a-Cust.NET-MVC-Project-Template_12902/registry-editor_2d901532-cb56-4a6b-aa8d-a128cb9a8ad0.png "registry-editor")

Since I’m lazy, I put these registry settings in a .reg file to make it
easy to install. You’ll just need to modify the settings within the .reg
file to match your project template.

**32-bit**

```csharp
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\MVC3\
    ProjectTemplates\MyProjectTemplate]
"Title"="My Project Template"
"Description"="This is the coolest project template EVAR MADE."

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\
    MVC3\ProjectTemplates\MyProjectTemplate\C#\Razor]
"Path"="CSharp\\Web"
"SupportsHTML5"=dword:00000000
"SupportsUnitTests"=dword:00000000
"Template"="MyProjectTemplate.cshtml.zip"
```

**64-bit**

```csharp
Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\MVC3\
    ProjectTemplates\MyProjectTemplate]
"Title"="My Project Template"
"Description"="This is the coolest project template EVAR MADE."

[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Wow6432Node\Microsoft\VisualStudio\10.0\
    MVC3\ProjectTemplates\MyProjectTemplate\C#\Razor]
"Path"="CSharp\\Web"
"SupportsHTML5"=dword:00000000
"SupportsUnitTests"=dword:00000000
"Template"="MyProjectTemplate.cshtml.zip"
```

The important thing to note are the options in the second registry
section:

-   **Path** – Relative path from the *ProjectTemplates* folder. For C\#
    projects, enter “CSharp\\\\Web”. For VB.NET use “VisualBasic\\\\Web”
-   **SupportsHTML5 –**Whether or not the project template supports
    HTML5. If set to 1, then the HTML 5 checkbox is enabled. That
    checkbox sets a project template variable, `$usehtml5$`. You can
    look at the default */Views/Shared/\_Layout.cshtml* inside of
    *MvcWebApplicationProjectTemplatev3.01.cshtml.zip*for an example of
    this.
-   **SupportsUnitTests** – This allows you to associate a unit test
    project template with your project template.
-   **Template** – the name of your project template file.

The last step is to run the command `devenv /installvstemplates` to
force Visual Studio to recognize the project templates.

I wrote a batch file, install.bat, when combined with the .reg file,
that automates these steps.

```csharp
cd %~dp0
regedit.exe /s project-template.reg
xcopy MyProjectTemplate.cshtml.zip "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio   10.0\Common7\IDE\ProjectTemplates\CSharp\Web\1033" /Y
devenv /installvstemplates
```

For your convenience, I packaged up the [necessary files in a zip
file](http://code.haacked.com/mvc-3/custom-project-templates.zip "Demo Project Template").
Unzip the file, and run *install.bat* and you’ll see a new project
template when you create a new ASP.NET MVC 3 project.

Pretty cool, eh?

By the way, I’m working on a book about ASP.NET MVC 3 with [Brad
Wilson](http://bradwilson.typepad.com/ "Brad Wilson's Blog"), [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/default.aspx "Jon Galloway's Blog"),
and [K. Scott
Allen](http://odetocode.com/Blogs/scott/ "Scott Allen's Blog"). We’ve
re-written large portions of the book in light of the new features that
were released in ASP.NET MVC 3. If you’re interested, feel free to
