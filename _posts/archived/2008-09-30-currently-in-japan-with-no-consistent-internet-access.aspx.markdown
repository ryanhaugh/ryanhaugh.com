The internet access I had at my mother-in-law's last time I was in Japan
turned out to be a fluke. I am at a Japanese Manga and Internet cafe
(because those three things go so well together) right now typing this
out. I've received a lot of comments and questions via my blog and once
I get to Hong Kong, I will do my best to answer.

No promises though as I hear that the pool at the hotel is nice and I do
have three talks to prepare. I must admit that not having daily internet
access is probably a good thing for me as I'm a total online junkie. :)

The next time we visit, I need to remember to bring more reading
material. I brought two books on Poker and am tired of reading about it.
;)
