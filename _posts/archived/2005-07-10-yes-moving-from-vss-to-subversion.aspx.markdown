I just received the good news from one of my clients that they installed
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/) over the weekend. We’ve all
been wrestling with using Microsoft Visual Source~~Crap~~Safe over the
VPN (and yes, we tried out SourceOffSite which helped) but the sheer
number of problems we ran into was overwhelming.

I had suggested they either look at [SourceGear
Vault](http://sourcegear.com/vault/) or Subversion. In the end, they
went with Subversion which is fine by me. That’s just one less SCC
Provider to deal with. Sweeeeet!
