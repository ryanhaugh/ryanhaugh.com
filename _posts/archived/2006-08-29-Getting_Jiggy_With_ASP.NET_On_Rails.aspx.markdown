Update: Rob [renamed his
project](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/PermaLink,guid,7f17b078-d04f-4103-8c23-cee21f31375a.aspx "Renamed to subsonic")
to Subsonic.

Rob Conery just [released ASP.NET ActionPack
1.0.1](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/ASPNETActionPack101Released.aspx "Like Ruby, but for ASP.NET")
on his blog today.  This project is definitely one to watch!  He is
essentially taking some of the principles of developing web apps with
Ruby on Rails and porting those ideas to ASP.NET.  Just watch this
[great
screencast](http://www.wekeroad.com/actionpackintro.html "A video walkthrough")
to get a taste of the progress he has made in a short time.

So far I am very impressed with this guy.  Yesterday evening I sent the
link to the screencast to [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "JonGalloway.ToString()")
who then wondered why he was using strings for table names.  I told him
to quit bothering me about it and post something in the [Codeplex
forum](http://www.codeplex.com/Wiki/View.aspx?ProjectName=actionpack "ActionPack on CodePlex"). 
But Jon, being the simultaneous type of guy he is, had already [posted a
comment](http://www.wekeroad.com/blogs/CommentView,guid,f8fe5aff-ebd3-40d9-acd6-38c6e1c2fc1f.aspx#5b655ae0-7ecd-4643-99b5-f4e3bc0ba713 "Whining")
on Rob’s blog before I could finish my sentence.  This all happened last
night.  This morning I notice the sixth bullet point in Rob's
announcement states that he added *struct in classes for column names*. 
Apparently he had received the comment, made the change, and sent a
reply to Jon in two hours.

Now that is a quick turnaround and good customer service! ;)

Not only that, but this guy lives in Kuaui, Hawaii! I don’t know how he
gets **anything** done unless it’s the rainy season right now.
[Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext project site") would
definitely languish if I lived in Kuaui.
