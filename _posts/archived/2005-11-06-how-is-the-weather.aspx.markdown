The title of my post is meant to indicate that this post is not
technical in nature, but rather just a bit of small talk, chit-chat,
idle conversation. You know, the sort of surface level conversation
meant to break the ice and pass the time. How is the weather where you
are?

The [weather where my parents and brother
live](http://weather.yahoo.com/forecast/USAK0012_f.html) is rather cold
right now. Today’s high was 20° F with a low of 8° F (that’s -6.7° C and
-13° C respectively). Tomorrow they will enjoy a brisk 12° F high and 2°
F low (which is -11° C and -16° C). Brrrr!

That’s why we’re looking forward to having them thaw out by visiting us
in December. Right now we’re enjoying a nice high of 75° F and a low of
56° (egads! Time to bust out a sweater!).

Meanwhile, we are excitedly looking forward to our trip to Spain coming
up. We are flying into Madrid, travelling to León and then Bilbao.
Afterwards we’re off to Barcelona for a few days before flying back.

Mi esposa y yo estamos practicando nos español para el viaje. When we
need to use the bathroom, we are fully prepared to ask, but hope they
point rather than give us directions.
