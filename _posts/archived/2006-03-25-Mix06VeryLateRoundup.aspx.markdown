![Craps](http://haacked.com/images/Craps.jpg)I apologize for writing up
a roundup for the Mix06 conference several days too late, but I was not
in a good condition to blog during the conference. In part it was due to
a cold I was fighting which left me unmotivated to blog. You might think
that the lack of sleep and drinking would have contributed, but the
strange thing about Vegas is that the less I slept, and the more I
drank, the better I felt.

When you are having interesting conversations with folks, you start to
lose track of just how many beers you’ve downed.

### Web Standards For Real

In any case, I was impressed with the conference less due to any
particular session (though there were some good ones), but more due to
the reflection on what appears to be true change happening in Microsoft.

One session in particular, the IE7 Future panel, struck me with who
Microsoft invited to attend. They had [Molly
Holzschlag](http://molly.com/ "Molly Holzschlag"), the group lead for
the [Web Standards
Project](http://webstandards.org/ "Web Standards Project"), [Eric
Meyer](http://www.meyerweb.com/ "Eric Meyer"), noted CSS guru up on
stage. I sat next to [David
Shea](http://www.mezzoblue.com/ "David Shea"), creator of CSS Zen
Garden.

These are not your typical Microsoft conference attendees and perhaps
have been some of the harshest critics of IE6. In part, this shows the
confidence that the IE7 team has in what they are trying to accomplish.
Several of these leading experts walked away from the conference with a

[feelings](http://meyerweb.com/eric/thoughts/2006/03/23/ie7-improvements-and-bug-tracking/ "Eric Meyer's Thoughts on IE7")
about what Microsoft is doing in this space.

### Fellow Bloggers

![Deck of Cards](http://haacked.com/images/black_jack.jpg) Of course the
best part of the conference is meeting my fellow bloggers. Almost
immediately [**Jon**](weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway") and I
ran into [**Jeff
Atwood**](http://codinghorror.com/blog/ "Jeff Atwood's Blog") who is
quite funny in person.

I also ran into the dynamic duo, [**Adam
Kinney**](http://www.adamkinney.com/ "Adam Kinney") and [**Erik
Porter**](http://weblogs.asp.net/eporter "Erik Porter"). I met these
guys at Tech-Ed 2004 in San Diego when they both worked at the same
company in Indiana.

Also met up with [**Andrew
Stopford**](http://weblogs.asp.net/astopford/ "Andrew Stopford") who is
a class act. We talked a bit about MbUnit and wondered how do we get the
word out about MbUnit. NUnit has a much larger penetration simply
because it was first (which is a big deal I suppose) and because of its
name. It falls under the so called “N-Series” of open source tools.

MbUnit, in my humble opinion, is much superior and definitely worth
trying out. I may try and prepare a talk to give at my local users group
on it someday.

Also hung out at the tables with [**Steve
Maine**](http://hyperthink.net/blog/ "Blog.Save()") and [**Clemens
Vasters**](http://staff.newtelligence.net/clemensv/ "Clemens Vasters").
Steve and I had a great run at the craps table only to lose much of it
at the BlackJack table. Meanwhile, Clemens taught us an interesting
travel game that involves people watching at hotel bars. I won’t divulge
the details nor the name of the game, but just know it was quite
interesting.

I’m sure I am missing someone, but it doesn’t matter. I had a great time
and am looking forward to Mix07 in whatever incarnation it may appear.
