Good news!
[SourceForge](http://sourceforge.net "SourceForge (new window)") now
supports using
[Subversion](http://subversion.tigris.org/ "Subversion Version Control (new window)")
for source control!

One complaint I received from developers who read my [Quickstart Guide
To Open Source Development With CVS and
SourceForge](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/05/12/QuickstartGuideToOpenSourceDevelopmentWithCVSAndSourceForge.aspx "Guide to using CVS with SourceForge (new window)")
is the sheer amount of complexity just to get started (not that it was
my fault, I was just the messenger). With Subversion, contributing to a
project on SourceForge is now much simpler.

Benefits of Subversion over CVS
-------------------------------

Subversion has several key benefits over CVS, a few of which are listed
here...

-   Subversion supports WEBDAV+DeltaV which works over HTTPS so that
    whole process of generating an SSH key is no longer necessary.
-   Checkins are atomic (“all or nothing”). This helps keep a check-in
    error from causing a broken build.
-   Subversion versions file and directory renames and moves.
-   Branching and tagging are fast as they are implemented as a copy
    operation within the repository.

Drawbacks to Subversion
-----------------------

The one key drawback to Subversion has to do with the last benefit
listed. This was an architectural decision by the Subversion team to
simplify and speed up branching and tagging. For branching, this is not
such a bad idea. A branch is simply another folder within the
repository. By convention, this tends to be a folder within a top-level
“branches” folder.

For tags though, this is not as ideal because Subversion does not
restrict editing tags. In fact, tagging as it is done in CVS does not
exist in Subversion. Tagging is merely a convention developers follow by
branching (a repository copy operation) to a subfolder of the top-level
“tags” folder. To enforce a tag, one would have to implement a hook
script to disable edits.

Software
--------

Before we continue with this guide, please download the following tools.

-   [TortoiseSVN](http://tortoisesvn.tigris.org/download.html "TortoiseSVN Download Page (new window)")
    - a Windows SVN client
-   [Official SVN
    Client](http://subversion.tigris.org/project_packages.html "Command Line SVN Client (new window)")
    (OPTIONAL: for those who prefer a command line client, though this
    guide will focus on using TortoiseSVN).

Checking Out a Repository
-------------------------

At this point, you are all set to get going. One key difference between
CVS and Subversion is that Subversion does not have the concept of a
“module” like CVS. In Subversion, all your code is organized into
folders within a repository.

1.  Make sure you’ve been added as a developer to the project you're
    going to work on. A project administrator would have to do this.
2.  In Windows Explorer go to the folder you wish to check the code out
    into.
3.  Right click and select the **SVN Checkout** command:
    ![Subversion Checkout context
    menu](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSvnCheckoutContext.png)
4.  This will bring up the following checkout dialog. You will need to
    know the url of the project’s repository. This should simply be
    **https://{project unix name}.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/{project
    unix name}**. The URL to the project’s trunk is typically located at
    **https://{project unix name}.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/{project
    unix name}/trunk**. Note that the url is “https” and not “http”.

    For example, the URL to the
    [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website (new window)")
    repository is
    **https://subtext.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/subtext**. However, it
    is not a good idea to check out the top level repository folder
    (believe me). That will download every file in every tag and branch.
    Instead, you should enter the URL to the trunk. For
    [Subtext](http://subtextproject.com/ "Subtext Project Website (new window)"),
    you would enter
    **https://subtext.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/subtext/trunk**

    ![TortoiseSVN Checkout
    Dialog](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSVNCheckout.png)

5.  TortoiseSVN will prompt you for your SourceForge username and
    password. You can optionally check a box to have it save your
    credentials so that you do not need to enter them every time.
6.  At this point, I received an invalid certificate dialog. Hopefully
    this will be fixed soon as it is not generally a good habit to
    accept an invalid certificate.
    ![Invalid Certificate
    Dialog](http://haacked.com/images/InvalidCertificateDialog.png)
7.  Wait patiently as files are retrieved from the repository and copied
    to your local machine.

Now Write Some Code
-------------------

Note that you only have to checkout the repository once. Afterwards you
can run the update command to get changes committed by other developers.
It's a good idea to do this before and after you make any changes.

![TortoiseSVN Update Context
Menu](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSVNUpdateContextMenu.png)

Commiting Changes {.clear}
-----------------

After you've changed some files, their icons be marked with an orange
arrow. To commit your changes, right click and select the Commit
command. Please make sure to enter an informative comment.

![TortoiseSVN Commit Context
Menu](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSVNCommitContextMenu.png)

To commit multiple changes, right click on the root folder and select
Commit. You'llget a list of all changed files. You can check the ones
you wish to commit and commit them in bulk.

Adding Files
------------

If you add a new file to the project, you'll need to add it to
Subversion and *then* commit it. To add a file, simply right click on it
and select "TortoiseSVN | Add".

![TortoiseSVN Add File Context
Menu](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSVNAddFileContextMenu.png)

Know when to ignore {.clear}
-------------------

TortoiseSVN is not integrated with Visual Studio.NET. Thus it doesn't
know that there are some files you do not want to add to Subversion such
as **\*.suo**, **\*.pdb** and maybe the **bin** and **obj** folders.
There are a couple ways to tell Subversion to ignore certain files.

The way Subversion handles ignored files is different from CVS. In CVS
ignore settings are repository wide. For Subversion, the ignore list is
a folder by folder setting. Thus ignoring a file within a folder does
not necessarily apply that setting to its subfolders.

The quick way to add a specific file or file extension to the ignore
list for a folder is to right click on the file and select **TortoiseSVN
| Add To Ignore List**.

![TortoiseSVN Add To Ignore List Context
Menu](http://haacked.com/images/TortoiseSVNAddToIgnoreListContextMenu.png)

Since this ignore list only applies to the specific folder (and not to
subdirectories), another approach is to setting an ignore list for the
project is to right click the root folder and select the normal Windows
**Properties** dialog. You will notice a **Subversion** tab in the
dialog.

![Subversion Property
Dialog](http://haacked.com/images/SubversionFolderPropertyDialog.png)

This dialog allows you to specify various Subversion properties
(meta-data) including one called **svn:ignore**. Select the svn:ignore
property (or if it is not in the drop down, just type it in there).
Underneath the drop down, you can type in wildcards for the file
extensions to ignore. If you wish to set each sub-folder with the same
svn:ignore values, then check the **recursive** checkbox before clicking
**Apply** or **OK**.

Submitting Patches as a Non-Developer {.clear}
-------------------------------------

If you do not have developer access, you can still submit patches to a
project. In most SourceForge project sites, there is a “Patch” section
where patches can be submitted. In order to learn how to submit and
apply patches, read the following article [Using a Windows version of
GNU Patch.exe with CVS and Diff
Files](http://www.hanselman.com/blog/PermaLink,guid,b6603ac5-3464-490f-a557-62f56b7f5668.aspx "Creating Patches for CVS (new window)").

Conclusion
----------

Again, I hope this gets you on your feet when joining an open source
project on SourceForge. By supporting Subversion, SourceForge has
removed some of the complexity in getting involved. Subtext will be
migrating to Subversion at some point in time. When we do so, I will be
sure to update this document with any lessons learned.
