![Toshiba Portege M205](/images/Toshiba.jpg) Wohoo! And it is a thing of
beauty. Unfortunately I've been crazy busy lately so I don't have any
pictures so you'll have to settle for this stock photo.

Acquiring a new computer is a laborious affair. Step one is to download
and install Windows SP2 and all other critical updates etc... Second is
to install [RSS Bandit](http://www.rssbandit.org/) Then its the process
of installing all the rest of the software, tools, and tweaks I've grown
reliant on.

I'd like to backup all my photos and music on there, but that wouldn't
leave me much room for anything else. I'll have to carefully cull a
selection of music worthy to carry around.

**Anybody have software recommendations for the Tablet PC? In what ways
do you use it differently than you do a laptop in your day to day
operations?**

UPDATE: I forgot to mention, it's a Toshiba Portege M205 with 60GB hard
drive, 512MB RAM, and 1.5? MHZ Intel Celeron.
