Four friends who hadn’t seen each other in 30 years, reunited at a
party. After several drinks, one of the men had to use the rest room.
Those who remained talked about their kids.

The 1st guy said “My son is my pride and joy. He started working at a
successful company at the bottom of the barrel. He studied economics and
Business Administration and soon began to climb the corporate ladder and
now he’s the president of the company. He became so rich that he gave
his best friend a top of the line Mercedes for his birthday.”

The 2nd guy said “Damn, that’s terrific! My son is also my pride and
joy. He started working for a big airline, then went to flight school to
become a pilot. Eventually he became partner in the company, where he
owns the majority of its assets. He’s so rich that he gave his best
friend a brand new jet for his birthday.”

The 3rd man said “Well, that’s terrific! My son studied in the best
universities and became an engineer. Then he started his own
construction company and is now a multimillionaire. He also gave
something very nice and expensive to his best friend for his birthday: a
30,000 square foot mansion.”

The three friends congratulated each other just as the fourth returned
from the restroom and asked “What are all the congratulations for?”

One of the three said “We were talking about the pride we feel for the
successes of our sons. What about your son? The 4th man replied “My son
is gay and makes a living dancing as a stripper in a nightclub.” The
three friends said “What a shame....what a disappointment.” The 4th man
replied “No, I’m not ashamed. He’s my son, I love him and he’s lucky,
too. His birthday just passed and he received a beautiful 30,000 square
foot mansion, a brand new jet and a top of the line Mercedes from his
three boyfriends!”
