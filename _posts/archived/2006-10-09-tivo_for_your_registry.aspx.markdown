Ever prolific [Jon
Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway Blog") has
released another tool on our [tools
site](http://tools.veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT Tools").  When we started the
tools site, I talked some trash to spur some friendly competition
between the two of us.  Let’s just say Jon is kicking my arse so hard my
relatives in Korea can’t sit down.

His latest
[RegmonToRegfile](http://tools.veloc-it.com/tabid/58/grm2id/17/Default.aspx "Regmon to Regfile")
tool works with yet another
[SysInternals](http://www.sysinternals.com/ "Sysinternals") tool,
[Regmon](http://www.sysinternals.com/Utilities/Regmon.html "Regmon").

Winternals (maker of Sysinternal) released many fantastic tools for
managing and spelunking your system.

So great, in fact, that
[Robb](http://blog.robballen.com/ "Robb Allen Blog") feels he [owes them
his
child](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/10/08/Power_Tools_For_Disk_Defragmenting.aspx#17917 "Gratitude Comment")
in gratitude.

Kudos to Microsoft for [snatching up Mark Russinovich and Winternals
Software](http://www.sysinternals.com/blog/2006/07/on-my-way-to-microsoft.html "On My Way To Microsoft").

Regmon is essentially a Tivo for your registry, allowing you to record
and play back changes to the registry.

Regmon lacks the ability to export to a registry (.reg) file, which is
where Jon’s tool comes to play.  It can parse the Regmon log files and
translate them to .reg files.

Here is a [link to Jon’s blog post on this
tool](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/archive/2006/10/09/_5B00_Tool_5D00_-RegmonToRegfile-_2D00_-Record-and-playback-registry-changes.aspx "RegmonToRegfile").
