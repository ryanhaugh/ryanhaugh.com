When I started blogging, I was a category ascetic. I figured I should
keep categories to a minimum across very strict dividing lines. I was
going for a Zen approach. The thought process I had is that each
category should be a worthwhile feed to subscribe. So that if you're one
of my friends who doesn't know .NET from a fishing net, you could
subscribe to my [Day To Day](http://haacked.com/category/1.aspx) feed.

But that doesn't exactly work as I don't cross-post often. Today I
realized, I needed to break the ascetism and become a "Category
Hedonist". I was trying to find every post I've written about category
spam. I realized the only tool I had for finding those posts was Google.
No longer. I've added several categories, and hope to add more in the
hopes of *categorizing* (hey how about that? Categories are for
categorization) my posts. It's useful for me, and hopefully for some of
you.
