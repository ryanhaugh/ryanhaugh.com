Remember the book I mentioned that [I was
writing](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/11/19/Writing_A_Book.aspx "Writing a Book")
along with a few colleagues? Well it is finally [available for
pre-order](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/098028581X?ie=UTF8&tag=youvebeenhaac-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=098028581X "The ASP.NET 2.0 Anthology")
on Amazon.com!

If you love me, you’ll buy five copies each. No. Ten copies!

Or, you could wait for the reviews and buy the book on its own merits,
which I hope it warrants. But what’s the fun in that?

All kidding aside, this was a fun and tiring collaborative effort with
[Jeff “Coding Horror” Atwood](http://codinghorror.com/ "CodingHorror"),
[Jon Galloway](http://weblogs.asp.net/jgalloway/ "Jon Galloway"), [K.
Scott Allen](http://odetocode.com/blogs/scott/ "K. Scott Allen"), and
Wyatt Barnett. The book aggregates our collective wisdom on the topic of
building web applications with ASP.NET 2.0 as a series of tips, tricks,
and hacks.

The target audience for the book is the intermediate developer looking
to raise his or her skills to the next level, so some of the material
quickly rehashes the basics to set the stage for more interesting tips
and tricks. The goal of the book is to be a survival guide for ASP.NET
developers. We’ve been bitten and had the poison sucked out of our veins
so you can avoid the vipers in the wild.
