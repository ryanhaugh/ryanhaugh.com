![C64](/images/C64.gif)It was really just a side question of this
[post](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/9917.aspx) on [Rory’s
blog](http://www.neopoleon.com/blog/) having nothing to do with the main
topic (some blather about Jury duty bla bla bla). *For 50 bonus points,
the question was what game featured the quote “You have summoned an
elemental”?*

![](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/archon.jpg)My winning answer
was *Archon*, thus securing the 50 pts redeemable for fame, fortune, and
street cred. Interestingly enough, the question summoned a swarm of
geeks reminiscing about the *good ol’ days* of gaming on the Commodore
64 in the comments section.

For good reason, Archon was a joy to play. I loved that game back in the
day. It was pure fun. Technically, I didn’t play it on a Commodore 64. I
had a Commodore 128, which I know is the same thing really, but it was a
larger number and it had some funky *CP/M* mode that did nothing for me.
In any case, in the comments of that post, I found that there’s a
[remake effort](http://www.archonevolution.com/ "Archon Remak") for
Archon. Awesome! It’s interesting to see that there’s a thriving C64
[retro gaming
community](http://www.commodoregames.com/ "Commodore Games") with a [C64
emulator](http://www.computerbrains.com/ccs64/ "Commodore 64 Emulator")
to support the cause.

As can be seen by such communities, the C64 inspired huge loyalty among
its fans back in the day which is still going strong. Heck even I joined
in the computer worship with my [C64 formatter for Rss
Bandit](http://haacked.com/archive/2004/04/23/c64-formatter-for-rssbandit.aspx "C64 Formatter").
Of course once I upgraded to the Amiga 500, my Commodore 128 turned into
a large paperweight. At that point I was a slave to Speedball, Pirates!,
and the Bard’s Tale. Not to mention the Ultima and Phantasie series.

Ah, I miss the good ol’ days of gaming. They weren’t the good ol’ days
because the games were much better necessarily (though many were quite
good). Rather, they were the good ol’ days because I had this thing
called “time” to actually play them.
