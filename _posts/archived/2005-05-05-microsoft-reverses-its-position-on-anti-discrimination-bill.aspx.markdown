From Scoble's blog we hear that...

> MAJOR NEWS. Steve Ballmer is sending email to all Microsoft employees
> explaining that Microsoft is reversing its position on the
> anti-discrimination bill.

You know, it would be petty to say it, but I will. I [Told You
So](http://haacked.com/archive/2005/04/24/2818.aspx)! ;) All kidding
aside, I'm heartened to see Microsoft change its positions. It just
shows that corporations can look solely past the bottom line and
consider the common good. In doing so, I believe it will support the
bottom line anyways in a more far reaching manner.

As for [those who worry
that](http://archive.scripting.com/2005/04/24#When:4:32:52PM)..

I'd like to point out two things. First, by choosing any product you're
endorsing certain causes whether you like it or not. You're wearing
clothes made by children in a sweatshop in Chile? Guess what, you're
supporting an oppresive system. Secondly, by purchasing Microsoft,
you're already supporting this particular position. This bill in
particular is merely a reflection of a policy Microsoft already has
internally regarding anti-discrimination. It's not taking rights away,
it's merely protecting rights in the corporate environment. In other
words, it's a gimme.
