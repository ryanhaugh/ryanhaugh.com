This is one of the funniest tech support stories I've heard in a long
time. Even you non-geeks can appreciate this...

> We sold a computer to an elderly lady who took it home. We had tested
> it, and it worked great at the store. But, when she got it home, she
> could not get it to turn on. I work on the phone with her for an hour.
> \
> \
>  **"Is everything plugged into the power strip, maam?"\
> "Yes, everything is."**\
> \
>  So, I was sent to her home. Sure enough, everything was plugged into
> the power strip ... including the power strip.
