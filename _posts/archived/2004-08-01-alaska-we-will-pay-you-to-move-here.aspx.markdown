UPDATE: I cannot help you move to Alaska. This post was written in 2004.
If you want to move to Alaska, please don’t contact me. Try looking for
information at the official [Alaska
homepage](http://www.state.ak.us/ "State of Alaska Homepage"). Thanks!

![Alaska’s Flag](/images/alaskaflag.jpg) As a relocated Alaskan, I read
[Rory’s post](http://neopoleon.com/blog/posts/7379.aspx) about moving
Canada to the right a bit so that Alaska could join the “lower 48” with
amusement. I don’t think that idea would go over too well with Alaskans,
as we...er...they take great pride in their independence, not only in
spirit, but in location. Not only that, it could affect the fishing
season, and you don’t mess with the fishing season in Alaska, the
biggest state in the Union. That’s right Texas, the stars at night are
even bigger and brighter in Alaska. Get over it, we rule you.

![Alaska Map](/images/alaskaMap.jpg) However, Alaska is not paradise on
Earth (except in the summer when the sun stays out quite late drinking
and carousing). Did you know they pay residents to live there? It’s a
little thing called the "Permanent Fund Dividend". The Permanent Fund is
a huge investment of oil revenues in a variety of stocks and bonds.
Around October of every year, the interest earned from the fund pays
each resident anywhere between 1 to 2 grand a year, depending on how
well the market does. Just in time for some good Christmas shopping.

Not only that, there’s no sales tax and no income tax in Alaska. Yeah.
Starting to sound like a good place to live, no? Well, before you rush
off to go panning for gold, keep in mind that winter lasts around 8 to 9
months of the year, so I hope you like winter sports.
