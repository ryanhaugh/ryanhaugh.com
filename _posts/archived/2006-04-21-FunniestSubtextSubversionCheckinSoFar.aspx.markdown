I noticed the following checkin message in the subtext commits mailing
list today (this is the mailing list in which we can receive Subversion
checkin notifications).

    Revision: 999
    Author:   simo
    Date:     2006-04-21 13:56:27 -0700 (Fri, 21 Apr 2006)
    ViewCVS:  http://svn.sourceforge.net/subtext/?rev=999&view=rev

    Log Message:
    -----------
    The link to Phil Haack blog was wrong 
    (http://haacked.com/blog) Fixed it.

    -- SNIP--

This had me cracking up because **I** am the one who added the link to
my own blog originally. It took someone else to notice the mistake and
fix it. An inability to link to oneself correctly. Is that a recognized
form of dementia?
