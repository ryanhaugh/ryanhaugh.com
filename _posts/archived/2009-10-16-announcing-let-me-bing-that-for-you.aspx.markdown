Despite what your well intentioned elementary school teachers would have
liked you to believe, **there *is* such a thing as a stupid question**,
and you probably get them all the time via email or IM.

You also know that in half the time it takes to type the question, the
person pestering you could have typed the query in their favorite search
engine and received an answer immediately.

[Let me Google that for
you](http://lmgtfy.com/ "Let Me Google That For You") addressed this
little annoyance by providing a passive aggressive means to tell
annoying question askers to bugger off while at the same time teaching
them the power of using a search engine to help themselves.

[![lmbtfy](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingLetMeBingThatForYou_D717/lmbtfy_thumb.png "lmbtfy")](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/AnnouncingLetMeBingThatForYou_D717/lmbtfy_2.png)When
I first heard about the Microsoft’s new search engine,
[Bing](http://bing.com/ "Bing"), I jumped at purchasing the domain name
[http://letmebingthatforyou.com/](http://letmebingthatforyou.com/ "Let Me Bing That For You")
(*though I was remiss in not also registering lmbtfy.com as well. If you
own that domain, may I buy it off of you?*)

Unfortunately, being way too busy caused me to leave the domain name
unused gathering dust until I put out a call on Twitter for help. Not
long after [Maarten
Balliauw](http://blog.maartenballiauw.be/ "Maarten's Blog") and [Juliën
Hanssens](http://hanssens.org/ "JHannsen's blog") answered the call and
put together the bulk of this ASP.NET MVC application using jQuery and
jQuery UI.

I really like what they did in that the background image for
[http://letmebingthatforyou.com/](http://letmebingthatforyou.com/ "Let Me Bing That For You")
changes daily to match the one on bing.com. I finally found some time to
review the code, do a bit of clean-up, fix some minor issues, and test
it so I am now ready to deploy it.

Keep in mind that even though I’m employed by Microsoft, this site is a
pet project I’m doing on the side in collaboration with Maarten and
Juliën and is in not associated with Microsoft nor Bing in any official
capacity. We’re just some folks doing this for fun.

Now [**go try it
out**](http://letmebingthatforyou.com/ "Let Me Bing That For You") and
release your inner snarkiness.
