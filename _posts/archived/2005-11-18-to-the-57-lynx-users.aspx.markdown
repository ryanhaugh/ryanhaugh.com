![Lynx](http://haacked.com/images/lynx.jpg) Welcome!

Just going through various stats on my blog today and noticed that last
month, there were 57 visits to this site using Lynx.

Lynx?

Are you serious?

Does looking at this site via Lynx make my ass look big?

Lynx, for the unitiated, is a text based browser designed to allow
mainframes to present a browsing tool to its users. It is the first web
browser I ever used back in college. You ain’t ever navigated the web
till you’ve done it in a text browser.

So to you Lynx users, I should mention that we now have these newfangled
32-bit processors that are capable of running browsers that can render
and format text and images. They’re really a hoot!

All kidding aside, my understanding is that people still use [Lynx for
accessibility
reasons](http://pubs.logicalexpressions.com/Pub0009/LPMArticle.asp?ID=196).
For example, blind people can have the site read to them with a Stephen
Hawking like voice. That’s pretty sweet.
