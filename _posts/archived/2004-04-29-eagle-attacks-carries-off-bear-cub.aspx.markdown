Memorial services for young BooBoo will be held tomorrow 10AM at the
ranger station despite the fact that his body has yet to be recovered.

Yogi Bear was visibly distraught at this unfortunate turn of events.
"Hey Boo Boo! Where are you?!" he was heard to say as he stole yet
another picnic basket to console himself. Despite his shaken state, he
will attend the memorial services.
