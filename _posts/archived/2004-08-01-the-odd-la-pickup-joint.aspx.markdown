I'm happily married, but if you're not, and you live in L.A., I
recommend you take your dog for a walk at the Barrington Dog Park, on
the east side of Barrington just south of Sunset. We were playing a game
of soccer, but we couldn't help noticing that all the talent was in the
dog park area adjacent to us. Looked like a bonafide LA pickup joint.
