I am a little late in reporting this, but I hadnâ€™t realized the problem
until I had to maintain an older project that used Log4Net 1.2.8. I
upgraded it to log4net 1.2.10 and noticed it stopped working. I then
found [this
comment](http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/logging-log4net-user/200506.mbox/%3CDDEB64C8619AC64DBC074208B046611C7692D5@kronos.neoworks.co.uk%3E "comment")
in the log4net mailing list archives.

I hope changes that would break existing config files are far and few
between.
