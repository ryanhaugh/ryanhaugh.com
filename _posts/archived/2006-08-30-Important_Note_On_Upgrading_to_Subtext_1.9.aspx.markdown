Let me start off by noting that **Subtext 1.9 requires ASP.NET 2.0**! 
Thus the upgrade process from a prior version of Subtext (all which run
on ASP.NET 1.1) will not be quite as simple as before, but should
hopefully not be overly complicated as is the spirit of Subtext.

For Users Who Have Control Of Their Hosting Server
--------------------------------------------------

Users who host on their own server, or have Remote Desktop access to
their hosting server will have an easier time with the upgrade.  My
recommendation is to simply setup a new folder with the new version of
Subtext, copy in your modifications, and then switch IIS over to ASP.NET
2.0 to point to the new directory.  The following is a step-by-step
detailed procedure.

1.  **Backup your Database.**This should go without saying.
2.  **While you are in Enterprise Manager, make sure the database user
    that your blog uses to access the database has DBO permissions
    temporarily.**  This is required so that the web-based upgrade
    procedure will work.
3.  **Make sure you can login to the HostAdmin section.**  On most blogs
    this would be the /HostAdmin/ directory of the site. For example, on
    my blog the HostAdmin is located at
    [http://haacked.com/HostAdmin/](http://haacked.com/HostAdmin/ "Host Admin"). 
    If you forget your HostAdmin password, there is a query you can run
    in Query Analyzer to reset your password at the bottom of [this
    page](http://subtextproject.com/Home/Docs/Upgrading/tabid/147/Default.aspx).
4.  **Download and unzip the Subtext 1.9 binaries into a new directory
    parallel to your current installation.**  For example, on my server
    I host my blog in the `d:\Websites\Haacked.com\` directory.  When
    upgrading to Subtext 1.9, I unzipped the distribution to the
    following path `d:\Websites\Haacked.com.1.9\`.
5.  **Merge any customizations from your old web.config file into the
    new web.config file.**  Be sure to note that some settings have
    moved. For example, the connection string has been moved into the
    `<ConnectionStrings>` section.  Also take a look at any new settings
    you may be interested in.
6.  **Copy all your images, videos, audio files and any other
    non-Subtext files and customizations into the appropriate place in
    the new directory.**For example, I copied the *images* folder as
    well as my own *Demos* folder which contained some demo code on my
    site into the *Haacked.com.1.9* folder.
7.  **Now in IIS Manager, configure your existing site to use ASP.NET
    2.0 and point it to your new directory.**  For details, see the
    section at the bottom of this post.  You may need to change the
    Application Pool your site runs in if you are running Windows 2003.
8.  **Visit your website and follow the instructions.* ***At this point,
    the normal web-based upgrade wizard should kick in, asking you to
    login to the HostAdmin tool and click the upgrade button.  This will
    upgrade your database schema and stored procedures.
9.  **Make sure to reverse the change you made in step 2!**  Subtext
    does not require DBO permissions for normal operations. The user
    that Subtext uses to connect to your database should just be in the
    public group.

For Users With Hosted Solutions Such as WebHost4Life
----------------------------------------------------

Unfortunately I am not familiar with the procedure that the various
hosting providers use to upgrade a site from ASP.NET 1.1 to ASP.NET
2.0.  If the upgrade happens on the same machine that your site is
currently hosted in, the upgrade may bring down your site for a short
bit.  You may have to coordinate the above steps with a technician at
your hosting company, **except for the following changes**.

-   **Step 4: Download and unzip the Subtext 1.9 binaries to your local
    machine.**
-   **Step 6: Have your hosting support technician upgrade your site to
    ASP.NET 2.0**
-   **Step 7:  Copy your local files over to your hosting provider.**

Configuring IIS for ASP.NET 2.0
-------------------------------

To configure a website in IIS for ASP.NET 2.0, right click on the
website in the IIS Manager tool and select properties. Click on the
*ASP.NET* tab in the dialog box. It should look something like this...

![ASP.NET Version
Dialog](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/WindowsLiveWriter/UpgradingtoSubtext1.9_10183/SNAG00254.png)

Makes sure to select **2.0.50727** in the *ASP.NET version* dropdown.

On Windows 2003, I created a separate Application Pool for my ASP.NET
2.0 websites.  To select the Application Pool for a website, cilck on
the Virtual Directory tab and select the Application Pool in the
dropdown at the bottom of the dialog as in the following screenshot.

Good luck and smooth sailing!
