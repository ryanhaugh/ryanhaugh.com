Back in March of this year I had the honor and delight to give the
opening keynote at [CodeMania](http://codemania.co.nz/ "CodeMania"), a
new conference in New Zealand. This conference was something special. I
mean, just look at their beautiful [lucha
libre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre "Lucha Libre on Wikipedia")
inspired site design.

Although inexplicably, they switched to a pirate theme when it came to
my profile image. Even so, it’s fun and the Twitter integration is a
nice touch. It’s time for me to tweet something very inappropriate.

On a personal level, this was a particularly special conference for me
as it was the first time I’ve been asked to deliver a keynote. The topic
I chose was about the love of coding and some of the barriers that can
dampen that love.

I touched upon some themes that I’ve written about here such as why we
should care [lack of
women](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/03/22/what-are-brogrammers-afraid-of.aspx "What are brogrammers afraid of?")
in our industry as well as the benefits of a work environment where
[employees feel trusted and
fulfilled](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/08/03/how-to-talk-to-employees.aspx "How to talk to employees").
I also riffed a bit about the GitHub work environment based on my brief
experience there as well as the blog posts by [Zach
Holman](http://zachholman.com/ "Zach's Blog") on [How GitHub
Works](https://github.com/blog/920-how-github-works "How GitHub Works").
It was a privilege and a lot of fun to give a talk that’s very different
from the ones I usually give.

Not only that, but apparently the talk touched a nerve for at least one
person who tweeted that this talk [made him leave his
job](https://twitter.com/kev_nz/status/239252199006404608 "Tweet about leaving his job")
in search of a better one!

**[You can watch the talk on
Youtube](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MELG2yRJd0E&sns=tw "I Love To Code")**.
Note that the title of my talk includes a swear word (I explain why). I
know some of you are sensitive to that so I thought I’d warn you in case
you’re watching this out loud with children around and would rather they
not hear such language.

You can view my [**“slides” here on
GitHub**](http://talks.haacked.com/presentations/2012/CodeMania/Keynote/#/title "CodeMania keynote slides").
The slides is actually a web page using Impress.js. You’ll probably need
to use Safari or Chrome to view them. As I [mentioned
before](http://haacked.com/archive/2012/06/19/talks-on-github-and-nuget.aspx "Talks up on GitHub"),
I’ve been posting my recent talks on Github. The GitHub project page for
my [talks are here](https://github.com/haacked/talks "Talks on GitHub")
if you want to clone them locally.

I should also reiterate that this talk was delivered to a New Zealand
audience. Hence the crack at the expense of Aussies. I have nothing
against Australians. Some of my close friends are Aussies. But when
you’re in the land of Kiwis, you do what you need to in order to get the
message across. Apparently the relationship between Kiwis and Aussies is
not unlike that of Canadians and Americans. No real hate back and forth,
but a lot of mutual ribbing.
