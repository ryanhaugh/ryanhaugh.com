As a web guy, I’ve slung more than my fair share of angle brackets over
the tubes of the Internet. The Razor syntax quickly became my favorite
way of generating those angle brackets soon after its release. But its
usefulness is not limited to just the web.

The ASP.NET team designed Razor to generate HTML markup without being
tightly coupled to ASP.NET. This opens up the possibility to use Razor
in many other contexts other than just a web application.

For example, the [help documentation for
NuGet.exe](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/reference/command-line-reference)
is written using the [Markdown
format](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) that is produced
by NuGet.exe. NuGet.exe reflects over its own commands and and uses a
Razor template to generate the properly formatted output.

The check-in that enabled this caught my eye and prompted me to write
this blog post as it’s a very clean approach. I’ll show you how to do
the same thing in no time at all.

RazorGenerator
--------------

The first step is to install the **RazorGenerator** extension from the
Visual Studio Extension Gallery.

If you haven’t used the Extension Gallery before, within Visual Studio
click on the **Tools** \> **Extension Manager** menu option to launch
the Extension Manager dialog. Select the **Online** tab and type in
“RazorGenerator” (without the quotes) in the upper right search bar.

Make sure to install the one named “Razor Generator” (not to be confused
with “Razor Single File Generator for MVC”).

Create your application
-----------------------

For my sample application, I created a simple console application and
added a reference to the following assemblies:

-   System.Web.WebPages.dll
-   System.Web.Helpers.dll
-   System.Web.Razor.dll

I then added a new text file and named it *RazorTemplate.cshtml*. You
can name yours whatever you want of course.

Make sure to set the **Custom Tool** for the CSHTML file to be
“RazorGenerator”. To do that, simply right click on the file and select
the **Properties** menu option. Type in “RazorGenerator” (sans quotes)
in the field labeled **Custom Tool**.

![Razor-file-properties](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Text-Templating-With-Razor_141F0/Razor-file-properties_3.png "Razor-file-properties")

I added the following code within the CSHTML file:

{% raw %}
<pre class="csharpcode"><code>
<span class="asp">@*</span> Generator : Template TypeVisibility : Internal <span class="asp">*@</span>
<span class="asp">@</span><span class="kwrd">functions</span> {
  <span class="kwrd">public dynamic</span> Model { <span class="kwrd">get</span>; <span class="kwrd">set</span>; }
}
<span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">ul</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>
<span class="asp">@</span><span class="kwrd">foreach</span> (<span class="kwrd">var</span> item <span class="kwrd">in</span> Model) {
  <span class="kwrd">&lt;</span><span class="html">li</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span><span class="asp">@</span>item.Name (<span class="asp">@</span>item.Id)<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">li</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span>  
}
<span class="kwrd">&lt;/</span><span class="html">ul</span><span class="kwrd">&gt;</span></code></pre>
{% endraw %}

That first line is a generator declaration. It’s required to by the
Razor Generator. I chose to make the generated template class internal.

The next line starts a *functions* block. I specify a property for the
template named `Model` in there. If you’re not a fan of the `dynamic`
keyword, please don’t freak out. At least not yet.

I simply chose a dynamic property for the purposes of demonstration, but
I could have just as easily made it a strongly typed property. Well, not
just as easily as I would have had to create a another type first. But
you get the idea.

In fact, I could have added multiple properties to this template if so
desired. These properties and methods added here will show up in the
generated template class.

The next section is simply the usual razor syntax markup you know and
love which is written against the property I defined. In case you’re out
of practices with Razor, be sure to check out the [C\# Razor Syntax
Quick
Reference](http://haacked.com/archive/2011/01/06/razor-syntax-quick-reference.aspx "Razor Syntax")
I wrote a while back.

Render the template
-------------------

Now all we need to do is instantiate the template, populate the
properties we defined in the template with real values, and we’re done!

So what exactly are we instantiating? The steps we took up until now
results in the Razor file generating a template class. If you expand the
CSHTML file, you can see the generated class.

![Razor-Generated](http://haacked.com/images/haacked_com/Windows-Live-Writer/Text-Templating-With-Razor_141F0/Razor-Generated_3.png "Razor-Generated")

That’s the class we need to instantiate. Here’s some code I added in
*Program.cs* that makes use of this generated template class.

```csharp
class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        var template = new RazorTemplate {
            Model = new[] { 
                new {Name = "Scott", Id = 1},
                new {Name = "Steve", Id = 2},
                new {Name = "Phil", Id = 3},
                new {Name = "David", Id = 4}
            }
        };
        Console.WriteLine(template.TransformText());
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

The code is very straightforward. It simply instantiates an instance of
the `RazorTemplate` class and sets the `Model` property (which is the
property I defined within the template) as an array of anonymous
objects.

Again, for demonstration purposes, I’m using a dynamic property to
access anonymous objects. You can just as well pass in and render
strongly typed properties.

After instantiating the template instance, we simply call the
`TransformText` method on it and write the response to the console.

Easy as stepping on a Lego block in the dark!

Note that using Razor as a general text templating langage might not
always produce the best results. It was heavily geared towards rendering
markup (aka angle brackets) which it’s very good at. Your mileage may
vary when attempting to render other types of textual output.

In a following post, I’ll show you a cool way I’m using this technique
for a library I’ve been working on meant to demonstrate some cool
internals of ASP.NET MVC.
