A while ago [I
mentioned](http://haacked.com/archive/2006/09/21/Subtext_Success_Story.aspx "Subtext Success Stories")
that [my company](http://veloc-it.com/ "VelocIT"), in collaboration with
[Shepard
Associates](http://www.shepardassociates.com/ "Shepard Associates") built
two websites for a [medical device
company](http://conceptus.com/ "Conceptus") using
[DotNetNuke](http://dotnetnuke.com/ "DotNetNuke Portal") (aka DNN).

Well we just learned that the client's websites we built [won three
WebAwards](http://biz.yahoo.com/bw/061102/20061102005379.html "Conceptus Websites Earn Excellence Awards")
from the [Web Marketing
Association](http://www.webaward.org/ "Web Awards"). Cool!

I will admit, I don't know much about the association or their awards. 
It just feels good to see our hard work (by *our* I mean everyone
involved including the client and Shepard) recognized.  Especially
considering the torturous work it took to coerce, fight, and bend DNN to
obey our will in order to implement these sites.
