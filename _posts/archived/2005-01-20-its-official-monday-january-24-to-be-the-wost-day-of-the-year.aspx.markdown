A Dr. at Cardiff University has created a [scientific formula to
prove](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/4187183.stm) that January 24th
will be the worst day of the year.

> The formula for the day of misery reads 1/8W+(D-d) 3/8xTQ MxNA. Where
> W is weather, D is debt - minus the money (d) due on January's pay day
> - and T is the time since Christmas. Q is the period since the failure
> to quit a bad habit, M stands for general motivational levels and NA
> is the need to take action and do something about it.

Well I could have told him that without this fancy formula. January 24
is the day after my 30th birthday. It's all downhill from there. ;)
