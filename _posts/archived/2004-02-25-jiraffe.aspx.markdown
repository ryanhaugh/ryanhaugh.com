We went on a triple date last night with Walt, Celine, Dan, and Judy to
eat at Jiraffe. They are having some sort of Monday prefixe special.
Unfortunately, a lot of French food has egg product in it to give it an
added richness, which makes it difficult for my wife. I, on the other
hand, had no problem with any of the food. Especially the Fois Gras.
Very rich and tasty!
