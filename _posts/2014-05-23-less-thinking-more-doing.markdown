Finally, after years of saying I'm going to do it, I've finally started my blog!

So...what took so long?

Let's just say that I could give a seminar on procrastination. In fact, it's so near and dear to my heart that I actually wrote a poem about it when I was 12 - I wrote it 15 minutes before it was due because I needed something to hand in to my teacher.

And I figured the best time to start a blog is right now, when people are saying blogging isn't important anymore...

I'll mostly be blogging about ASP.NET MVC and Web API, but I'll also be blogging about front-end technologies since I'm splitting my time 50-50 between front and back end right now.

Stay tuned...
