Ryan Haugh is a Denver-based software engineer who has been developing enterprise applications on the .NET stack since way back in the .NET 1.1 days.  He is relentless about keeping up with the latest technological trends and helping his development teams to come along for the ride.

Ryan is OCD about improving developer productivity while increasing the reliability of his team's code, and is obsessively thinking about new and more efficient ways to solve existing problems using new techniques he discovers along the way.

He is a recovering consultant who has worked for everything from start-ups to established corporations and currently splits his time 50-50 between the server side using ASP.NET MVC & Web API and the client-side using an ever-evolving toolset.
